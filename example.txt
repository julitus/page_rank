July 1966) was an [[England|English]] professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who was most famously a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the 1920s.  Billy Butler had never played for any form of organised football team prior to joining the army. He played as a centre-forward for his regiment and on leaving the army he joined his hometown club [[Atherton F.C.|Atherton]] at the age of 19. He moved to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in April 1920 and, on moving to the right wing, soon established himself. He played in the 1923 [[FA Cup Final]] victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], the famous first [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final, and the following year, on [[April 12]], [[1929]], made his [[England national football team|England]] debut against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].   It was to be his only appearance for the England national team, but he was back at Wembley again for the 1926 FA Cup Final win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and picked up his third winners medal in 1929, scoring the opening goal in the 2-0 defeat of [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].   On Bolton's relegation in 1933, Bulter asked for a transfer and left to join his former Bolton team-mate [[Joe Smith (footballer)|Joe Smith]], who by now was manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. He had played 449 games for Bolton, scoring 74 goals.  In August 1935, Smith left to manage [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and Butler took over the reigns at Reading and carried on with the good work Smith had started. Reading never finished below 6th place in [[Division Three (South)]] during Butler's tenure and were heading for another top five finish when he resigned in February 1939.   He became manager of [[Guildford City F.C.|Guildford City]], but then the [[World War II|war]] intervened and Butler joined the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] as a [[Physical education|PT]] instructor. With the war over, Butler was appointed manager of [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in August 1945, but left [[Plainmoor]] in May 1946 before [[Football League|league football]] had resumed.   He subsequently moved to [[South Africa]] to manage [[Johannesburg Rangers F.C.|Johannesburg Rangers]], where he discovered the future [[Wolverhampton Wanderers|Wolves]] defender [[Eddie Stuart]]. He was later a coach for the Pietermaritzburg &amp; District Football Association and then a coach for the Rhodesian Football Association  Butler died in [[Durban]] in July 1966, aged 66.  {{start box}} {{succession box|  before=?|  title=[[Guildford City F.C.|Guildford&amp;nbsp;City&amp;nbsp;Manager ]]|  years=1939-[[?]]|  after=? }} {{end box}} {{Reading F.C. managers}} {{Torquay United F.C. managers}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Butler, Billy}} [[Category:English footballers]] [[Category:England international footballers]] [[Category:Football (soccer) wingers]] [[Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players]] [[Category:Reading F.C. players]] [[Category:Reading F.C. managers]] [[Category:Torquay United F.C. managers]] [[Category:People from Atherton, Greater Manchester]] [[Category:1900 births]] [[Category:1966 deaths]] [[Category:The Football League players]];',

He was a cousin of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].  ==Biography== John Williams Stoddard was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]] to Henry and Susan (Williams) Stoddard. Henry Stoddard (1788-1869) was a pioneer citizen and distinguished lawyer of Dayton. John was educated in the private schools of Dayton, and spent his freshman and sophomore years at [[Miami University]]. He next entered the junior class at [[Princeton College]], where he graduated in the class of 1858. Following his father's profession, Mr. Stoddard graduated from [[Cincinnati Law School]] in 1860. He practiced law in Dayton for two years but decided to abandon the legal profession for a business career. In May 1861 John W. Stoddard married Susan Keifer (1841-1921).  In 1862 John Stoddard began the manufacture of [[linseed oil]] in partnership with his brother Henry, and Charles G. Grimes, under the firm name of Stoddard &amp; Grimes. That business was continued for three or four years when it was enlarged, and the manufacture of [[varnishes]] was added, the firm also dealing by wholesale in paints, oils, window glass, etc., under the name of Stoddard &amp; Company. In 1869, Stoddard sold his interest to his brothers. The company later became part of the Lowe Brothers Company of Dayton.  In 1869, John Stoddard then began the manufacture of agricultural implements in partnership with John Dodds, under the firm name of John Dodds &amp; Company. The Farmers Friend Manufacturing Company was incorporated as a stock company in 1871 as producers of high class agricultural implements constituting a complete line of [[sowing|planting]], [[harvesting]] and [[tillage|tilling]] machinery under the Farmers Friend, Excelsior, Monarch brands. This was succeeded by J. W. Stoddard &amp; Company and in turn, in 1884, was incorporated as the Stoddard Manufacturing Company, of which Stoddard was the president and principal stockholder. Their distinctive brand of &quot;Tiger&quot; was a mark of excellence in agricultural machinery the world over. The chief implements made by the Stoddard Manufacturing Company were [[mower]]s, [[hay rake]]s, [[seed drill|press drills]], and [[harrow (tool)|disc harrows]]. The best known of these were the famous Tiger Rake, Tiger Harrow, and Havana Press Drill. More than 200,000 of the Tiger Rake had been sold by 1890. In the mid-1890s, they diversified to take advantage of the [[bicycle]] craze then sweeping the United States, manufacturing the Tiger (and Tigress), Cygnet, and Tempest lines of bikes until 1898.  His interest in the financial possibilities of transportation was revealed by his involvement as Secretary in the Third Street Railway, five miles (8 km) of urban streetcar rails that ran the full length of Third Street in Dayton, and which gradually acquired other urban rail operators in Dayton. In the 1880s, Stoddard was also Vice President of [[Milburn Wagon Co.]], a Toledo, Ohio wagon manufacturer that originally built farm wagons but then evolved to produce bodies for [[Willys]] &amp; [[Pope-Toledo]] in 1909 and then several models and styles of its own electric vehicles from 1915-1923 called the Milburn Light Electric. Milburn was sold to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 1923.  In 1903, John W. Stoddard and his son Charles (1866-1921), having made a fortune in agricultural equipment, turned to making automobiles. John sent his son to Europe where he toured continental auto manufacturers. In 1904, Stoddard Manufacturing Company was reincorporated as Dayton Motor Car Company and they began the manufacture of the [[Stoddard-Dayton]] automobile. It became the second largest employer in Dayton, second only to Barney &amp; Smith, occupying the {{convert|68000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} plant at Third and McDonough Streets that had been built for the agricultural implements forerunner in 1871. That landmark stood until 1994.   The Stoddards competed in those years with other local Dayton companies including the [[Speedwell Motor Car Company]], the Dayton Electric Car Company, the Darling Motor Car Company, the Apple Automobile Company, and the Custer Specialty Company, but without question, the Stoddard-Dayton was one of the highest quality automobiles made in its time. In 1909, the Stoddards formed the Courier Car Company (effectively a division of Dayton Motor Car) to manufacture smaller, cheaper automobiles, heavy trucks and taxicabs. The Courier company occupied an earlier Stoddard building at Fourth Street and Wayne Avenue.  A Stoddard-Dayton won the first race at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in 1909 and was the pace car in 1911 for the first [[Indianapolis 500]]. In 1910, the Dayton Motor Car Company was sold to [[United States Motor Company]] of Detroit, a rival of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]].  John W. Stoddard died in Dayton in 1917. His son and partner Charles Grimes Stoddard died less than four years later and Susan Stoddard, John's wife, died a few months after Charles. The Queen Anne-style Stoddard mansion stood on Grafton Hill overlooking the [[Great Miami River]] and the city of Dayton. In 1926, it was razed to make way for the Dayton Masonic Temple (now Masonic Center).  The John W. Stoddard family, including his parents, brothers and children, are interred at [[Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio]].  == Patents == Stoddard used patent protection on his agricultural products.

	(int) 5 => 'Paretz -> '''Paretz''' is a [[village]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Brandenburg]] in the district of [[Havelland]], west of [[Berlin]]. Recently, a district reform made Paretz into a borough of the city of [[Ketzin]].  It has a population of approximately 400. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the village was the summer residence King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and of his wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]].  [[Image:Paretz Ortseingang.jpg|thumb|Gate houses at the entrance to Paretz]]  == Paretz Palace ==  The manorial estate of Paretz was originally property of the von Bredow family from whom, in 1677, the Brandenburg diplomat [[Christoph Caspar von Blumenthal]] bought it. It was from here that his daughter Wilhelmina eloped with Ernst Christian von Weiler, a married man, in 1689. The estate was inherited by Count [[Heinrich von Blumenthal]], former commander of the [[Garde du Corps (Prussia)|Garde du Corps]], who in retirement was tutor to the Crown Prince Frederick William (later King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]).   The Crown Prince had a sad childhood, but he was always happy staying with his tutor at Paretz. For this reason, in 1795 he bought the estate of ''Paretz'' from his tutor's son, his former playmate Count Heinrich von Blumenthal, for 80,000 [[Thaler]]s (approximately ??? 120,000 as of 2005).  The Berlin architect [[David Gilly]] was put in charge of the construction of the building and it was planned to become a country palace.  &quot;Just remember always that you are building for a poor farmer&quot;, the crown prince is said to have told the architect.  Flanking the palace were placed two barn buildings each, on the left and right, (one on each side to house animals) thus forming a semi circular yard.  In 1804 the royal couple had the entire village rebuilt to conform to David Gilly's designs but the uniform style is hardly recognizable anymore today.  After the death of Queen Louise in 1810 the palace was left unchanged until 1840 when [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] had the wallpaper and furniture replaced in several rooms.  The appeal of the ''Schloss-Still-im-Land'' was lost however and the palace remained untouched and empty until early in the 20th century.  The palace continued to be owned by the [[Hohenzollern]] until 1945:  King Frederick William IV had passed the palace on to King [[Wilhelm I of Germany| Wilhelm I]] who became Emperor of Germany in 1871.  In 1888 Prince [[Albert Wilhelm Heinrich of Prussia|Heinrich]] took over the palace and his wife [[Princess Irene of Hesse and the Rhine]] continued after his death in 1929.  In April 1945 the [[Red Army]] took possession of the grounds and the troops didn't leave until halfway through 1946.  A year later, [[refugee]]s moved into the buildings and in 1948 ownership of the palace was transferred to the ''Zentrale Verwaltung der gegenseitigen Bauernhilfe (ZVdgB)'' (&quot;Central Administration of Mutual Aid to Farmers&quot;).  Modifications to the complex through 1950 completely changed the look of the palace and farm.  Special attractions of the palace are the tapestries that are adorned with exotic plant motives, bird renditions and depictions of landscapes in the [[Potsdam]] area.  The tapestries survived [[World War II]] as they had been removed and kept in the [[New Palace]] in Potsdam for safe keeping.  {| | [[Image:Chateau Paretz.JPG|thumb|left|Paretz Palace]] | [[Image:Chateau Paretz Facade.jpg|thumb|Facade of the palace]] |}  == Gothic house == [[Image:Paretz Gotisches Haus.jpg|thumb|200px|Gothic house]] The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] house is a former royal [[forge]].  It is notable as the only neo-Gothic structure among the other rather simple buildings.  Currently, a restaurant is being operated in the Gothic house.  == Paretzer Erdl??cher == During the 19th century the production of tiles was an important industry for the area as they could be sold to the ever growing city of Berlin.  Therefore, many villages had several tile producing companies.  But to make the tiles clay was needed and mined from the clay ground common to the area.  When the business slowed down, the clay mines filled with [[ground water]] and turned into small lakes, the ''Erdl??cher'' or &quot;holes in the ground&quot;.  Today they are home to numerous water fowl and have been placed under environmental protection.  &lt;gallery&gt; Image:Paretz ERDLOECHER08.jpg Image:Paretz ERDLOECHER15.jpg Image:Paretz Erdl??cher.jpg Image:Paretz ERDLOECHER11.jpg &lt;/gallery&gt;  == Theodor Fontane == [[Image:Fontane in Paretz.jpg|right|200px]] The German poet and author [[Theodor Fontane]] liked the village a lot and come to visit Paretz three times:  in the spring of 1861, 1869 and in May of 1870.  He describes the farm Paretz in his '' Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg'' in vivid colors:  :&quot;Uetz and Paretz are separated by little more than half a mile.  On a summer afternoon this is an inspiring walk.  The path leads through the meadows and the smell of hay is present from the fields all around us.  A thin, fog lit by the sun marks the spot where the wide Havel with its many bays and lakes lies.  Paretz itself does not appear to us until the very last.&quot;  :&quot;Finally the path turns into a levee and instead of the fruit trees that so far have kept us company there are tall [[poplar]]s and royal buildings everywhere until we cross a light and elegant bridge, called the ''Infantenbr??cke'', and reach the village road.  The road takes us through the park then grows wider just after going around a bend and we are there.&quot;  ==References== ''This article is based on a translation of an article from the [[:de:Hauptseite|German Wikipedia]]''.  == External links ==  *''[http://www.paretz-verein.de/ Verein Historisches Paretz]'' *''[http://www.louise-kult-tour.de/ LOUISE-KULT-ToUR]'' *[http://www.gotisches-haus-paretz.de/ Gothic House Restaurant].  {{coord|52|28|N|12|53|E|display=title}}  [[Category:Villages in Brandenburg]] [[Category:Buildings and structures in Brandenburg]] [[Category:Palaces in Germany]]  [[de:Paretz]] [[pt:Schloss Paretz]];',
	(int) 6 => 'Carr Lowrey Glass Company -> '''Carr Lowrey Glass Company''' ([[1889]]-[[2003]]) was a manufacturer of glass bottles.  ==Establishment== Carr Lowrey Glass Company founded in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in [[1889]]. Located on the [[Middle Branch River|Middle Branch]] of the [[Patapsco River]] in a neighborhood named [[Westport, Baltimore|Westport]], Samuel Carr and William Lowrey established their company to create glass bottles for the pharmaceutical and perfume industries. As seen from the locally famous [[Hanover Street Bridge]], just west of [[Fort McHenry]], you could see the towering smoke stacks and piles of discarded blue glass in piles behind the factory.   Their company grew over the years as they were one of the first companies to utilize an &quot;IS Machine,&quot; a machine that had individual sections that were timed to automatically blow and move the bottles to a [[conveyor system]].   In [[1944]], they were acquired by the [[Anchor Hocking|Anchor-Hocking Glass Company]]. During this time, the company experienced major expansion. Carr-Lowrey was one of the producers of the famous [[Avon Products|Avon]] bottles that were shaped like cars, planes, animals, and also white glass shampoo bottles for [[Head &amp; Shoulders]], as well as facial cream bottles for [[Procter &amp; Gamble]].  ==Plastic bottles== As the global economy moved toward plastic bottles after [[World War II]], the company's began to see fewer orders. To make matters worse, the company's glorified 6-Tank was shut down during a strike and was never restarted. Ownership of the company changed hands several times as the company struggled to find its niche. Moreover, Carr Lowrey had formidable competition in New Jersey with [[Wheaton Industries|Wheaton Glass]] and from foreign companies such as [[Saint-Gobain|St. Gobain]] in France and Rocco Bormioli in Italy. St. Gobain eventually opened a plant in Georgia, which spelled doom for Carr-Lowrey.   The Abell Foundation, a local Baltimore philanthropy, loaned Carr-Lowrey money in an effort to keep an historic business in Baltimore alive. Unfortunately, Carr-Lowrey was never able to remain profitable and eventually closed its doors in 2003.   ==Rebirth==  The image of Baltimore as a rusting industrial city seems to be fading. The city's downtown is now vibrant with activity from financial companies and bio-technology from nearby [[Johns Hopkins University]] and the [[University of Maryland at Baltimore]]. With this rebirth of the city, the waterfront property in and around town has become desired property for developers. The land once occupied by Carr-Lowrey Glass Company is now slated for waterfront housing. With Baltimore's Light Rail running right next to the property, a nearby exit to [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], and a main road straight into downtown, the former Carr-Lowrey Glass Company site is considered by many an ideal place for residential and commercial development.  In 2004, Patrick Turner, owner of [[Turner Development Company]], purchased the property once occupied by Carr Lowrey.  He soon purchased the electric generating plant next door that was owned by [[Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-te.bz.turner24dec24,1,5670717.story Topic Galleries - baltimoresun.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  == References == {{reflist}}  {{List of glass companies}}  [[Category:Defunct glassmaking companies]] [[Category:Companies based in Baltimore, Maryland]] [[Category:Defunct companies of Maryland]] [[Category:Companies established in 1889]];',

It was named for [[Illinois]] State Treasurer at the time of its establishment, William Butler. It occupies approximately 53 acres, and is the site of 19,824 interments as of the end of 2005.  Camp Butler National Cemetery was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.  == History == [[Image:Camp Butler, Confederate graves.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Confederate graves]] During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Camp Butler was the second largest military training camp in Illinois, second only to [[Camp Douglas (Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. After [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln's]] call for troops in April, 1861, the [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] sent then [[Brigadier-General]] [[William T. Sherman]] to Springfield, Illinois to meet with Governor [[Richard Yates (governor)|Richard Yates]] for the purpose of selecting a suitable site for a training facility.  Since Governor Yates was unfamiliar with the land around Springfield, the state capital of Illinois, he enlisted the aid of then-State Treasurer William Butler, who along with Oziah M. Hatch, [[Secretary of State of Illinois]], took a carriage ride with William T. Sherman to examine land about 5 and 1/2 miles northeast of downtown Springfield. An area near Riverton, Illinois (then known as &quot;Jimtown&quot;, short for Jamestown) was selected, and named in honor of William Butler. A [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] training facility was officially established there on [[August 2]], [[1861]].  Originally the camp was designed to train and &quot;muster-in&quot; Illinois troops for the Civil War, it was quickly pressed into service to house the approximately 2,000 [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers who had been taken prisoner at the surrender of [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]], in [[Kentucky]] on [[February 16]], [[1862]]. By the war's end, over 200,000 Union troops would pass through Camp Butler.  [[Image:A04 1705.JPG|thumb|right|250px|German POW graves]] An area was set aside for the burial of Confederate [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who died at the camp. As many as 700 prisoners died in 1862 when [[smallpox]] and other diseases were rampant in the camp. The situation was aggravated by the poor living conditions the prisoners endured there, and they were interred in the cemetery in their own Confederate section. A total of 866 Confederate prisoner's graves can be found today in the National Cemetery. They are buried side by side with 776 graves of Union soldiers and enlistees, making a total of 1,642 Civil War graves.  Along with the soldiers who fought on both sides of the Civil War, veterans who lost their lives in the [[Spanish-American War]], both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]] are also buried at Camp Butler. There are also [[Germany|German]] and [[Korea]]n prisoners of war buried there, relocated from a cemetery near [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].  == Notable interments == *Seaman [[John H.

Wurster was born in [[Stockton, California]] and is strongly associated with the Bay Area and its regional style, along with Wurster's mentor [[Bernard Maybeck]], the landscape architect [[Thomas Church]], and fellow architect [[Joseph Esherick]].  Wurster designed hundreds of California houses in the 1920s through the 1940s using indigenous materials and a direct, simple style suited to the climate.  His 1928 Gregory Farmhouse in [[Scotts Valley, California]] is regarded as the prototypical ranch-style house.    In 1940 Wurster married [[Catherine Bauer Wurster|Catherine Bauer]], an influential figure in her own right in the field of [[public housing]].  Both withstood accusations of disloyalty during the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] of the 1950s.    Wurster was elected a [[FAIA|Fellow]] of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) in 1954 and he received the AIA Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement in 1969.   He was a co-founder of the [[UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design]], where Wurster Hall is named in his and his wife's honor.    Among Wurster's students was the award-winning architect [[John Desmond]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].  Jim Webb, who taught at the University of North Carolina and was an influential architect in Chapel Hill, worked with Wurster for a while.  == Readings ==   * Gregory, Daniel, &quot;William W.

The Committee of Elections ruled that since neither the Constitution nor the laws of Ohio specified residency requirements, the certification of the governor of Ohio that Griswold was a resident was sufficient for his appointment. |- | 1815 | [[Jesse Bledsoe]] | [[Kentucky]] | Seat declared vacant | Bledsoe had sent a letter of resignation to the state government of Kentucky in December 1814.  On [[January 20]], [[1815]], after a successor had been named but before that successor had appeared before the Senate, Bledsoe submitted a letter to the Senate requesting to know whether he still retained the seat or if the seat had been declared vacant.  The Senate then declared the seat vacant. |- | 1825 | [[James Lanman]] | [[Connecticut]] | Not seated | On [[March 4]], [[1825]], the Senate met in special session.  Lanman's term had expired at the close of the previous day, so he presented new credentials from Connecticut's governor, appointing Lanman to his seat until the state legislature convened in May.  The credentials had been issued in late February so that they could reach Lanman by the start of the new term.  The Senate ruled that the governor lacked authority to issue credentials in advance of a vacancy and so denied Lanman his seat. |- | 1827 | [[Ephraim Bateman]] | [[New Jersey]] | Retained seat | Bateman had been the chairman of the joint meeting of the New Jersey state legislature to elect a replacement for [[Joseph McIlvaine]].  With the field narrowed to two candidates, Bateman had won the election by a vote of 29???28, with Bateman providing the one vote margin.

A memorial service was held at [[Bristol Cathedral]] on [[November 19]], [[1957]]. A memorial plaque at the crash site, now called Britannia Wood, was unveiled on November 3, 2007 by the widow of the plane's pilot, Mrs Statham, and the local MP [[Roger Berry]].  ==Cause== The exact cause of the crash was never determined, but was suspected to be a malfunction of the autopilot, possibly due to faulty wiring. The company which manufactured the autopilot system issued a statement claiming it was not due to the autopilot system, but still altered the system in newer aircraft, the official report states unknown cause but &quot;the autopilot system cannot be ruled out as the likely cause&quot;.  Another source cites the cause as &quot;...an instrument failure which ultimately led to a loss of control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | publisher = Airdisaster.com   | title = Accident Synopsis ?? 11061957   | url= http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11061957&amp;reg=G-ANCA&amp;airline=Bristol+Corporation   | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Casualties==  Several of these 15 names were NOT aircrew they were Redifon's Flight Simulator Project Team. I knew Ken Barker and Graham Lucas well as I would have been part of the factory's calibration team.I was away with the RCAF in Canada at the time of the crash.

He was famed for his frugality with both private and public funds, and was nicknamed &quot;'''Blue Jeans Bill'''&quot; for his humble style of dress.  ==Biography== James Douglas Williams was born on [[January 16]], [[1808]] in [[Pickaway County, Ohio]]. He moved with his family to [[Knox County, Indiana]] at the age of 10, and settled near [[Vincennes, Indiana]] where he remained much of the rest of his life. He received little schooling, but did occasionally attend the log schoolhouse near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' father died in 1828, and being the oldest son, Williams became the caretaker of his family, continuing to run his fathers farm. In 1831 Williams married Nancy Huffman, and together they had seven children. With Williams regularly in the public service, she ran the family farm for much of her life. She suffered a fall in January, 1880 and died on June 27, 1880.&lt;ref name = w148&gt;Woollen, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  ===Public career===  In 1839 Williams first entered public service serving as [[justice of the peace]] of [[Vincennes, Indiana]] until he resigned in 1843. The same year he was elected to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] and remained in the General Assembly until 1874, serving in both houses.&lt;ref name = w148/&gt; Williams was responsible for the authorship of many bills, including laws that permitted widows to inherit the estate of their husbands. He wrote the bill that established the state's first sinking fund. He also encouraged the development of the State Board of Agriculture and served as a member for sixteen years, during which time he accumulated a large estate of lands.&lt;ref name  = w149&gt;Woollen, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; William became known for his frugality with both public and private money. He never purchased expensive clothing but instead choose to wear homespun clothes and denim, earning him the nick name &quot;Blue Jeans Bill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[American Civil War]] Williams' was accused of being a [[copperhead (political)|Copperhead]] when he attempted to interfere with the war effort and submitted legislation to require Governor [[Oliver Morton]] to show what the money in the state emergency fund was being spent on.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872 he was the Democratic candidate for the [[United States Senate]], but was defeated by [[Oliver Morton]]. Williams was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Indiana in 1874 and served from 1875 to 1876. During this time he served as chairman of the committee on accounts and was responsible for considerable reform, and significant saving by cutting business costs. While still in Washington he was informed that his party had nominated him to run for governor, and nomination he was not a candidate for. Instead of declining, he decided to not seek reelection to Congress, but instead returned to Indiana to campaign for governor.&lt;ref name  = w149/&gt;  ===Governor===  Williams was elected governor of Indiana in 1876, defeating future [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Benjamin Harrison]] in a close election, winning by about 5,000 votes. Williams became the only farmer to be elected [[Governor of Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He was inaugurated on [[January 9]], [[1877]]. During his administration he sought and acquired funds to being the construction of a new state capitol building. He sought to run the government with economy but sought increased funding for the state assistance programs to the war veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;  He was instrumental in finding the funds for Purdue University and was a &quot;women's rights&quot; activist before such a thing was even known  championing the right for women to own property. He fought for budegetary constraint and was known for his thrifty management of the house's budgetary committee.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in late October 1880, Williams developed a [[kidney infection]]. His health steadily deteriorated and he died shortly before the ends of his term as governor in Indianapolis, on November 20, 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; James Douglas &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; Williams is buried in a rural [[Monroe City, Indiana]] cemetery on ground he donated to establish Walnut Grove Methodist Church near his home.  His family purchased a large obelisk for his grave which was unveiled on July 4, 1883, and it still stands above the tiny Bedford Stone church in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Woollen, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the members of the church are Williams descendants.  == Obituary== The following is Governor Williams obituary in the [[New York Times]].[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01E0DF123FEE3ABC4951DFB767838B699FDE]  Gov. Williams Dead. The Home-Life and Public Services Of Indiana's Governor. Indianapolis, Indiana Nov. 20- The illness from which Gov. Williams has been suffering for nearly three weeks terminated fatally at 12:30 o'clock today.  Such a result has not been anticipated until within the past 48 hours and even then it was the opinion of his physicians that he might live several days, if not weeks.  For 15 years the Governor has been subject to bladder inflammation, and it was this, aggravated by malarial fever, that caused his death.  He died in the room he has occupied since his incumbency, the Executive office in the Washington Clubhouse, there being with him his physician, the nurse the wife of the janitor of the building, and Judge Scott, of the Supreme Court, and his son, John Williams, who arrived at midnight from Wheatland, Knox County.  the Governor's only other child, Mrs. Eliza Dunn, a widow, was compelled to remain at the homestead, near Wheatland, by sickness.  The Governor's death was very peaceful.  For 12 hours he had been unconscious and he did not rouse at all, but passed away without a word or a muscular quiver.   James Douglas Williams was born in Pickaway County, Ohio, Jan. 16, 1808.  His parents were Virginians.  His grandfather was from Scotland, coming to this country in the middle of the eighteenth century and locating on the James River.  George Williams, the Governor's father, settled in Ohio in an early day in the history of that State and thence removed to Knox County, Indiana where the family home has been ever since.  The Governor's father died in 1828 , leaving him the eldest of a family of six children.  He remained with his mother on the farm until he was 21 years old, when he married Nancy Huffman, the daughter of a neighbor, and the two began a life in a rough location on a quarter section of wild land.  As the result of their work, the Governor leaves probably the finest farm home in Indiana.  His estate, compromising over {{convert|2000|acre|km2}}, is in splendid cultivation, and with comfortable, generous improvements.   Mrs. Williams died a few months ago from the effects of a fall, and five of seven children are also buried on the homestead.  His wife's death greatly affected the Governor.  His associates have noticed a great change in his manner, but never a word of complaint or repining from his lips.  At the old home, a room was always kept for his use, fitted up with a broad fireplace and the furniture to which he had been accustomed to in early life.  At one of his windows, his wife always sat to welcome him on his return home.  Since her death he has not cared to return to the scene of his loss.  He went occasionally, but it was always a trial.  Recently, his daughter missed him from his usual place, and after a long search he was found in the barn, his grief welling up in great sobs that shook his frame.  His domestic life was a happy, homely, modest one.   His public life began in 1839 by election to the office of Justice of the Peace.  In 1841 he was elected to the lower house of the State Legislature by 90 majority, though the county was strongly Whig.  Defeated in 1843, he was elected in 1845, and successively until, in 1858, he was elected to the State Senate, and kept there almost continuously until 1874.  In 1872 he was the caucus nominee of his party for United States Senator to succeed Senator Morton.  In 1874 he was elected Representative from the Second Congressional District to succeed the present Supreme Court Judge Niblack.  At the expiration of his term he came home to take the candidacy of his party for Governor, in 1876 - he having been nominated as a compromise between Franklin Landers and William S. Holman, between whom the convention of 1876 was divided.  He canvassed the State, accompanied by Senator Vorhees and was elected over General Benjamin Harrison by a plurality of 5,500 votes.  The Governor wore a suit of blue jeans, the yarn for which was spun by his wife.  From this fact he was called &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; Williams.&quot;  This habit he kept up until within a short time when he bought a suit of clothes of another color and texture.  For 16 years he was a member of the State Board of Agriculture, and for 4 years was its President.  He was the devoted friend of the common school system of the State in the earlier years of its development, and assisted Gov. Whitcomb and Gov. Wright in laying the foundation for our present splendid school fund.  Probably no man in Indiana was better versed in State legislation, as no man has ever served so long a time in its General Assembly.   Governor Williams was 6 feet, 4 inches in stature, of spare build, weighing only 170 pounds. His personal appearance was such that he was called the Abraham Lincoln of Indiana.  His angular features and ungainly figure, clad in his homespun jeans, made him a curious spectacle.  He was rugged in his virtues, simple in his tastes, Spartan in his honesty, and although uneducated and unpolished, he served the State to the best of his ability, was a pure upright man in all private relations and commanded the respect and confidence of all the people.  His last public appearance was three weeks ago tonight at the dedication of the new dining hall of the House of Refuge at Plainfield.  He took to his bed on the evening of the Presidential election day, Nov. 2.   A meeting of citizens was held tonight attended by prominent men of all parties.  Senator McDonald presided and Secretary of State Shanklin acted as Secretary.  Committees were appointed to arrange for the funeral of Gov. Williams.  The Committee on Memorial is headed by United States Judge Gresham and is to report to a meeting to be held Monday morning at 9 o'clock.  The body will lie in state at the Courthouse from 11 o'clock Monday morning until 5 in the evening.  On Tuesday it will be taken to Vincennes and lie in state 3 hours and be then taken to Wheatland for interment.  Mayor Caven has issued a proclamation asking for the suspension of business between 11 and 12 o'clock Monday morning and 5 and 6 in the afternoon during which hours the body will be moving from the clubhouse to the Courthouse.  A committee consisting of Senator McDonald and General Harrison was appointed to invite the President and Cabinet members of Congress and Governors of adjacent States to attend the funeral.  Telegraphic invitations went forward tonight.  The pall bearers will be ex Govs Hendricks and Baker, Messrs. English and Landers, Gov. Gray, Mayor Caven, Judge Niblack, Gen. Manson, State House Commissioners Nelson and Morris, W.R. McKeen of Terre Haute, and Judge Scott of the Supreme Court.

It replaced the original terminus which was further west and alongside [[Loch Linnhe]] at Station Square, in close proximity to Macbraynes bus station and pier. The old station was a stone built construction featuring a turret and a double arched entranceway. The station had three platforms, and was demolished to make way for a new road. The station lies in the shadow of [[Ben Nevis]]. The present station buildings are an unattractive 1970s grey concrete construction.  The station is on the [[West Highland Line]] and the starting point for ''[[West Coast Railway Company|The Jacobite]]'', the only scheduled steam hauled train to run on the mainline in Great Britain.  Refurbishment of the facilities at Fort William railway station have recently{{Fact|date=September 2008}} been completed thanks to a ??750,000 investment. The refurbishment includes new shower facilities and refurbished toilets. The shower facilities include two showers for ladies, two for gentlemen and one unisex shower facility for disabled people. Use of these shower facilities is free of charge for first class Caledonian Sleeper ticket holders and costs ??3.50 for standard passengers and station users.  Anyone wishing to use the showers also receives a towel to use once they are finished showering, which is then returned to the staff in charge of the maintenance of the showers. The showers themselves are private cubicles to allow maximum possible privacy for customers.  == Services == The [[Caledonian Sleeper]] starts and terminates here.  As part of the West Highland Line, the station sees 6 trains in each direction per day, being 4 standard trains, ''[[West Coast Railway Company|The Jacobite]]'' and the Caledonian Sleeper. Of the standard [[First ScotRail]] trains, 3 a day run from Glasgow via Fort William and on to Mallaig, with one running just from Fort William to Mallaig, timed to connect with the Caledonian Sleeper. ''The Jacobite'' runs from Fort William to Mallaig during the summer months, only stopping at [[Glenfinnan]] and [[Arisaig]]. Finally, the Caledonian Sleeper arrives early-morning from London via Edinburgh, and leaves early-evening along the same route.  {{rail start}} {{rail line two to one |next      = |previous1 = [[Spean Bridge railway station|Spean Bridge]] |previous2 = [[Banavie railway station|Banavie]] |route1    = [[First ScotRail]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[West Highland Line]] |route2    = [[First ScotRail]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[West Highland Line]] |col       = ff80c0}} {{rail line |next      = |previous  = [[Spean Bridge railway station|Spean Bridge]] |route     = [[First ScotRail]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Caledonian Sleeper|Highland Caledonian Sleeper]] |col       = ff80c0}} {{rail line |next      = |previous  = [[Glenfinnan railway station|Glenfinnan]] |route     = [[West Coast Railway Company]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''The Jacobite''&lt;br&gt;May-October |col       = 800000}} {{Historical Rail Insert}} {{rail line two to one |next      = |previous1 = [[Spean Bridge railway station|Spean Bridge]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Line and Station open |previous2 = [[Banavie Pier railway station|Banavie Pier]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Line mostly open; station closed |route1    = [[North British Railway]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;background:#{{NBR light}}&quot;&gt;[[West Highland Railway]] |route2    = [[North British Railway]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;background:#{{NBR light}}&quot;&gt;[[West Highland Railway]] |col       = {{NBR colour}} }} {{rail line |next      = |previous  = [[Banavie railway station|Banavie]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Line and Station open |route    = [[North British Railway]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;background:#{{NBR light}}&quot;&gt;[[Mallaig Extension Railway]] of [[West Highland Railway]] |col      = {{NBR colour}} }} {{end box}}  == Signalling == Since its opening in 1975, the present Fort William station has been equipped with colour light [[Railway signal|signals]].

It is located on the [[West Highland Line]]. The routes to [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]]/[[Mallaig]] and [[Oban]] diverge after this station. Access to the platform is via a flight of stairs from a subway that runs underneath the tracks, from the car park which is slightly lower than the station itself.  == History == Crianlarich station opened concurrently with the West Highland Railway in 1894, doubling the number of railway stations in the village.  The station was laid out with a [[crossing loop]] around an [[island platform]] and [[rail siding|sidings]] on both sides. On the east side were was an engine shed and a [[turntable (railroad)|turntable]]. At the north end of the station, there was a junction with a link line to the [[Callander and Oban Railway]]. Originally, the junction incorporated a scissors crossover, allowing simultaneous moves through the junction.  In 1953, [[British Rail]] added the suffix &quot;Upper&quot; to the station's name, in order to distinguish it from the nearby station (only about 300 metres' walk along the north east access road) on the Callander and Oban Line which then became known as '''[[Crianlarich Lower railway station|Crianlarich Lower]]'''.  Since closure of the Callander and Oban Line east of Crianlarich in 1965 (during the [[Beeching_Axe|Beeching cuts]]), all trains to Oban have been routed up the West Highland Line as far as Crianlarich Upper station. They then join the remaining part of the Oban line by means of the link line, which had formerly been infrequently used. Crianlarich Lower station also closed in 1965. Some years later, the Upper station's name reverted to &quot;Crianlarich&quot;.

Timber leaving the area is transported by rail, being loaded in sidings to the west side of the station.  == [[Railway signalling|Signalling]] == From the time of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric [[Token (railway signalling)|token system]]. Crianlarich [[signal box]] was situated at the north end of the island platform.  In 1967, the method of working between Crianlarich and [[Rannoch railway station|Rannoch]] was changed to the [[Scottish Region]] Tokenless Block system. In August 1985, the method of working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the electric token block system.  The semaphore signals were removed in stages during December 1985 in preparation for the introduction of [[Radio Electronic Token Block]] (RETB). Track layout alterations were made at the same time, including simplification of the junction and extension of the crossing loop at the south end. The RETB, which is controlled from a Signalling Centre at [[Banavie railway station]], was commissioned from [[Helensburgh Upper railway station|Helensburgh Upper]] to [[Upper Tyndrum railway station|Upper Tyndrum]] and [[Taynuilt railway station|Taynuilt]] on [[27 March]] [[1988]].

	(int) 29 => 'Welsh surnames -> [[Image:Familytree 200.jpg|frame|Welsh Genealogical History]]  Fixed [[family name]]s are a recent introduction to [[Wales]]. Before they were imposed for legal purposes, [[patronymic]] surnames were used.  The [[Welsh people|Welsh]] used an ancient patronymic naming system whereby the children of a marriage took their father's [[forename]] as their surname. As a result surnames were not fixed, and changed from generation to generation: so that Evan son of Thomas William would be known as Evan Thomas; Evan's son, John would be John Evan; John's son Rees would be Rees John; and David's son, James, would be James David.   Names such as Edward and William sometimes added an 's', becoming Edwards and Williams. Names ending in 's' like Thomas remained unchanged. Such names may originally have been carried into Wales by English settlers, as patronymic surnames with the short -s form are recorded in various parts of England dating back to the [[Middle Ages]].   Traditionally women kept their [[maiden name]]s when they married as there was no surname for them to adopt. The terms ''verch'' or ''ferch'', meaning &quot;daughter of&quot;, and abbreviated to ''vch'' or ''vz'', were sometimes used, though they are rarely found in [[parish register]] entries.  This practice continued up until the early 1800s in some areas, with [[rural]] areas clinging to the patronymic system longer than urban ones. Areas where [[England|English]] influence was strong abandoned patronymics earlier, as did town families and the wealthy.   Welsh communities are full of families bearing the same few surnames but who are completely unrelated, and it cannot be claimed that everyone named [[Jones]] or [[Evans]] must be related to everyone else named Jones or Evans.   Patronymics were essentially a [[genealogical history]] of the family, where one [[generation]] was connected to another by ''ap'', from ''map'' (''mab'' in modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), meaning &quot;son of&quot;.   Names such as Llewelyn ap Dafydd ab Ieuan ap Griffith ap Meredith were not uncommon. At the end of the 19th century, this practice ceased and ''ap'' was usually combined with one name to yield surnames such as Upjohn (from Apjohn) and Powell (from Aphowell).  ==Place in the UK today==  In the [[United Kingdom]] today, [[Wales|Welsh]] surnames are some of the most common. Of the ten most common surnames in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], six are of Welsh origin. [[Jones]], being the second most common name in Britain, is followed by [[Williams]] in third place, [[Davies]] in sixth place, and [[Evans]] and [[Thomas]] in eighth and ninth places respectively. [[Roberts]], which is ranked tenth, is also of Welsh origin.  ==External links== *[http://www.behindthename.com/nmc/wel.php The meaning behind Welsh names ] *[http://www.infokey.com/Surname.html General History of surnames, including Welsh] *[http://www.welshpedia.co.uk/wiki/wales/index.php?title=Welsh_Surnames Collection of Welsh Surnames (along with Male and Female first names)] *[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/sites/familyhistory/pages/surnames.shtml Welsh patronymic naming system] *[http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/talan/talanWelsh16.html Late Sixteenth Century Welsh Names ] *[http://www.writing-world.com/sf/name.shtml What's in a name?] *[http://shop.store.yahoo.com/4crests/samcoatofarf.html  Surname meanings] *[http://www.sog.org.uk/leaflets/surnames.pdf Interesting article on the relevance of surnames in genealogy] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]] File) *[http://www.users.waitrose.com/~brbeamond Welsh-Border Surnames from 'ab Edmond'] [[Category:Surnames]] [[Category:British Isles surnames]] [[Category:Welsh surnames]]  [[cy:Enwau'r Cymry]];',

	(int) 36 => 'The Little Black Boy -> {{Inappropriate tone|date=December 2007}}  [[Image:blake_black_boy.jpg|thumb|Blakes' first plate of ''The Little Black Boy'']] [[Image:Blake Little Black Boy.jpg|thumb|Blakes' second plate of ''The Little Black Boy'']] '''The Little Black Boy''' is a poem by [[William Blake]] published in ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' in 1789. It was published during a time when slavery was still legal and the campaign for the [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of slavery was still young.   == Analysis of the Poem ==  Blake believed in equality for all men, and this is reflected in this poem.  It may not be immediately obvious that this is the case, as the narrative in the first stanza plays upon the traditional stereotypes of &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot;, black being the colour that denotes evil and sin, - ''&quot;black, as if beareav'd of light&quot;'' - and white being the colour that denotes innocence and purity.  It becomes clear over the course of the poem, however, that Blake had a deeper message to convey to his reader. &quot;The Little Black Boy&quot; was published in 1789, a time when slavery was still legal and the campaign for the abolition of slavery was still young. In &quot;The Little Black Boy&quot;, Blake questions conventions of the time with basic Christian ideals. This becomes apparent in the third stanza, where Blake uses the sun as a metaphor for God and His Kingdom. This is a particularly interesting object to choose, as the word is, (on top of being a metaphor) a deliberate pun: ''&quot;Look on the rising sun: there God does live,&quot;''. This line is particularly important, as the reference to the sun not only introduces the running religious metaphor in the subsequent stanzas, but the fact that it is &quot;rising&quot; denotes change.  In accordance with the running metaphor of the sun, the fact that Blake speaks of ''&quot;black bodies&quot;'' and a ''&quot;sunburnt face&quot;'' in the fourth stanza seems to imply that black people are near God as a result of their suffering ??? for one can only become dark and sunburned as a result of being exposed to the sun's rays. In the final stanza this idea is developed further, as the black boy says that he will ''&quot;shade him'' [the English boy]'' from the heat&quot;'', this implies that the English boy's pale skin is not used to the heat (derived from God's love) ??? some critics assert that the paleness of the English boy in this poem is symbolic of the fact that the English were distanced from God as a result of their treatment of the black peoples.  In the 5th stanza, we see all of humanity being united: ''For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear, The cloud will vanish...'' In the 6th stanza this metaphor is continued: ''When I from black cloud, and he from white cloud are free,'' Here, Blake uses the clouds as a metaphor for the human body. These stanzas therefore imply that after physical life has passed, all will be united with God.  Also notable in this poem is Blake's use of politically neutral colours such as gold and silver when describing things of moral value. The most valuable things in life, in terms of spirituality and wisdom are anointed with colours that are indifferent to race and social class, yet are related to financial status, as gold and silver evoke images of precious metals  == External links == {{wikisource|The Little Black Boy}} * [http://www.english.uga.edu/wblake/SONGS/9/9kozlows.bib.html Criticisms of The Little Black Boy] * [http://www.tate.org.uk/learning/learnonline/blakeinteractive/works/songs_02.html Tate Online, engravings]  * [http://www.users.muohio.edu/mandellc/projects/aronowml/LitHome.htm Abolition Literature]  {{Template:William Blake|lit}} [[Category:1789 poems|Little Black Boy, The]] [[Category:Poetry by William Blake|Little Black Boy, The]];',
	(int) 37 => 'Christian Newcomer -> {{TOCright}} '''Christian Newcomer''' (1749-1830) was an [[United States|American]] farmer and preacher&lt;ref name=&quot;bisopwho&quot;&gt;[http://www.gcah.org/BulletinInserts/BI_Newcomer.htm A Bishop who organised his brethren]&lt;/ref&gt;, who was elected on [[5 May]] [[1813]] as the third [[Bishop]] of the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]].    ==Ordination== Peculiarly, Newcomer was elected Bishop by the Church before he was even [[ordained]] to the ministry (though he ''did'' hold the status of a full minister). [[Philip William Otterbein]] and [[Martin Boehm]], the founders of the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ|U.B. Church]], had not established a succession in the U.B. ministry by any rite of ordination.  The Miami [[Annual Conference]], therefore, in August 1813 addressed a letter to Otterbein asking him to ordain by the laying on of hands ''&quot;one or more ministers who afterwards may perform the same for others.&quot;''  The letter reached Otterbein in late September 1813, with Newcomer visiting him soon thereafter.  It was decided that Otterbein should ordain Newcomer, [[Joseph Hoffman]] and [[Frederick Shaffer]] (two other U.B. ministers).  Accordingly, on 2 October 1813, after a solemn period of worship and meditation, with the assistance of an elder of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], the Rev. [[William Ryland]], Otterbein ordained by the laying on of hands these three men, the first to be ordained in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.  This taking place just a few weeks before Otterbein's death. {{Evangelical United Brethren}}  ==Early life== Christian Newcomer was the son of Wolfgang and Elizabeth (Weller/Weber) Newcomer, the second of three sons born into this family, which included five daughters, as well.  Christian's grandfather, Peter Newcomer, brought his family to [[United States|America]] from [[Switzerland]] some time between 1719 and 1727.  They settled in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].  They were of distinctly [[Mennonite]] heritage.  Christian was [[baptism|baptized]] in and became a member of the Mennonite Church.  On [[31 March]] [[1772]], he married Elizabeth Baer.  He seems to have had little romantic feeling toward her, writing in his Journal ''&quot;I had to seek a housekeeper, which I found in Miss Elizabeth Baer, and entered with her into a state of matrimony.&quot; '' When she died thirty-nine years later, however, he showed his affection had matured, as he wrote ''&quot;This evening at 6 o'clock my dear companion departed this life, and resigned her immortal spirit into the arms of Jesus her Savior.  Peace be to thy ashes:  for many years thou has been a staff and comfort unto me; soon we shall be reunited where parting will be no more.&quot;''  Christian and Elizabeth Newcomer had four children:  Andrew, Jacob, David, and Elizabeth.  After his wife's death Christian made his home with Andrew.  As a young man, Christian Newcomer learned the carpenter's trade.  In time, he inherited the family farm, so took up farming instead.  Through out these early years, his friends continually urged him to preach.  This troubled him greatly.  In 1775, to escape the issue, he sold his farm in Lancaster County and moved to another he had bought at [[Beaver Creek, Maryland]], seven miles south of [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] in Washington County.  Shortly after moving he became seriously ill.  He believed he was dying and cried out for divine help.  The illness subsided, he was left with a determination no longer to fight the call to preach.  Shortly after his recovery he came under the itinerant preaching of Otterbein and Boehm and resolved to throw aside his inhibitions and go forth to preach.  Newcomer was also influenced in ministry by a close associate of Otterbein's, George Adam Geeting.  Indeed, as Koontz states ''&quot;Ere long the growing group known as'' Otterbein's People ''came to recognize not three great spiritual leaders'' (i.e., Otterbein, Boehm and Geeting), ''but four, and Newcomer was the fourth.&quot; '' The probable date for the beginning of Newcomer's itinerant ministry is 1777.  ==His Journal== More is known of Newcomer's life and ministry than of any of the other United Brethren leaders because of the extensive journal he kept, in which he recorded his own activities, contemporary activities in the U.B. Church, and many public events, as well.  Not long before his death, Newcomer and a long-time friend and co-worker, (the Rev.) [[John Hildt]] (who was a member of the Baltimore Church) began work on Newcomer's journal in preparation for publishing.  Shortly after his death, the U.B. Conference appointed a committee to examine the original manuscripts, also with a view toward publication.  Hildt was asked to undertake the task of transcribing, translating into English, and editing the personally written biography and journal of his close friend.    In 1834, four years after Newcomer's death, ''The Life and Journal of the Rev'd Christian Newcomer, Late Bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ'' was first published.  In covers primarily the period of 27 October 1795 to 4 March 1830.  A copy of this ''Journal'' resides in the [[Library of Congress]], where it has even served to establish definite dates and events of early U.S. history.  Although there is scant record of Newcomer's first eighteen years of ministry, his name does appear in the lists of the U.B. conferences of 1789 (at Otterbein's parsonage in Baltimore) and 1791 (at John Spangler's in [[York County, Pennsylvania]]). &lt;!-- ==Selected Writings== *  ==Biographies== * --&gt; ==References== *Behney, J.

	(int) 38 => 'Composition studies -> '''Composition Studies''' (also referred to as &quot;Composition and [[Rhetoric]],&quot; &quot;College Composition,&quot; &quot;Writing Studies,&quot; or simply &quot;Composition&quot;) is the professional field of writing research and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the [[United States]]. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate [[students]] must take freshman ??? sometimes even higher ??? composition courses. For example, in [[California]], all public [[colleges]] and [[universities]] have freshman and sophomore composition courses as requirements.    Many composition [[scholars]] study not only the [[theory]] and practice of post-secondary [[writing]] instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and [[genres]] on writers' composing processes. As written conventions and genres change over time, compositionists continue to learn how these changes influence writers and how writers work to change the conventions within which they work.  ==First-year composition==  Many American universities have a required freshman, or first-year, composition course. This is not always the same as a [[literature]] course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation; rather, composition courses often offer intensive instruction in writing [[non-fiction]], expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize the many stages of the writing process (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), and different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc).  Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.  ==Advanced Composition==  Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition.  Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see also Writing across the curriculum below).  For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.       ==Graduate studies==  Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than [http://www.rhetoric.msu.edu/rc_consortium/ eighty universities]. Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs, although it is increasingly the case that they found their own departments (e.g., of Composition Studies, Writing &amp; Rhetoric, Composition &amp; Linguistics, and so on) .  ==Second-language writing==   [[Second language writing]] is the practice of teaching writing to non-native speakers of English.  ==Writing across the curriculum==  Because academic discourse is not monolithic, many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic [[discourse]] communities.  ==Writing center==  Many colleges and universities have a [[writing center]], which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers.  ==See also==  * [[English studies]] * [[Professional communication]] * [[National Writing Project]] * [[Rhetoric]] * [[Contrastive rhetoric]] * [[Cognitive_rhetoric|Cognitive Rhetoric]] * [[Second language writing]] * [[Writing center]] * [[Technical communication]] * [[Technical writing]]  ==Further reading==  * [[b:Rhetoric and Composition|Wikibooks: Rhetoric and Composition]] * [[James A.

She then acquired further training in [[New York City]] at what is now the [[Parsons School of Design]] (then called the New York School of Fine and Applied Art), from which she graduated in 1939 [Stanton]. In New York she also studied at the New Theatre School. Her schooling complete, she began working in [[advertising]] design and acting in [[summer stock theater]]. From the sources, it is unclear whether she worked in these fields while still in New York, or only after returning to Baltimore. We do know, however, that she began [[painting]] seriously in 1940.  ===Becoming a painter===  In a letter to Thomas Yoseloff, she wrote (quoted in Yoseloff's ''Retrospective'', 1975, p.34) that &quot;prior to 1940 my background had been entirely in [[commercial art]]&quot; and that when she began painting seriously, she had to &quot;put behind me everything I had so carefully learned in the schools&quot; (p.34). She began a study of the history of [[painting]] and &quot;went through a progression of spatial conceptions&quot; (p.35) from [[cave painting]] through the [[Renaissance]], then concentrating on [[Cezanne]], [[Picasso]], and [[De Kooning]]. &quot;I was also much concerned with [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and heavy paint&quot;, she adds (p. 35).  ===Marriage and family - and children's books ===  After returning to [[Baltimore]], she married Herman Benjamin Frank in 1941. According to the biography in &quot;[[Baltimore County]] Women, 1930-1975&quot; listed below, Jane had previously been working as a [[commercial art]]ist &quot;for [[department store]]s and [[advertising]] agencies&quot;, but she &quot;gave up her career in [[commercial art]] for marriage and a family&quot; (p. 16). After marrying, she signed her worked consistently as &quot;Jane Frank&quot;, apparently never including a [[maiden name]] or middle initial. Her husband, a [[builder]], constructed their home, including a [[studio]] for his wife. With the initial demands of a new marriage and family presumably beginning to relax a bit, Jane Frank returned seriously to [[painting]] in 1947 (according to Stanton, p. 9).   In the following decade, while raising a family and rapidly developing as a serious [[Painting|painter]], the young mother also illustrated three [[children's books]].  ''Monica Mink''   (1948) featured, along with Jane Frank's illustrations, a whimsical text by the artist herself, entirely in verse, relating a tale in which (according to the review published by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]) &quot;In rhyme the obstreperous Monica Mink 'who wouldn't listen and didn't think' is finally taught that 'all Mother Minks know best'.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22who+wouldn%27t+listen+and+didn%27t+think%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books]. Thomas Yoseloff's ''The Further Adventures of [[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1957, [[New York]]), featured Jane Frank's block prints, which already show a penchant for collage-like textural juxtapositions and strong diagonal composition.  Jane Frank's 1986 obituary in the ''Baltimore Sun'' mentions that she published a third children's book, entitled ''Eadie the Pink Elephant'', with both text and pictures by the artist, and this is confirmed in an excerpt from ''Publishers Weekly'' available online [http://books.google.com/books?q=%22eadie+the+pink+elephant%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books].  ===Health catastrophes and recovery===  Professor [http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/2003/06oct03/06phoebe.html Phoebe B. Stanton] of [[Johns Hopkins University]] (see below) mentions that twice in the 20 years after 1947, Jane Frank suffered from illnesses which &quot;interrupted the work for long periods&quot;. The first of these catastrophes was a serious car accident in 1952, requiring multiple major surgeries and extensive convalescence, and the second was a &quot;serious and potentially life-threatening illness&quot; soon after her 1958 solo show at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. The latter illness was so severe, according to Stanton, that it interrupted Jane Frank's [[painting]] work for about two years.  ==The latter 1950s to late 1960s== ===Encountering Hans Hofmann, and discovering a &quot;sculptural landscape&quot;===  Health problems notwithstanding, the latter 1950s proved decisively fruitful for Jane Frank as a serious artist. Having fairly well recovered from her injuries in the traumatic 1952 accident, she studied for a period in 1956 with the great [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Hans Hofmann]] in [[Provincetown]], [[Massachusetts]], and this mentoring gave her a jolt of inspiration and encouragement. She soon had solo exhibitions at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] (1958), the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] (1962), the [[Bodley Gallery]] in New York (1963) and [[Goucher College]] (1963), among others.   She also, in 1962 (1961 according to some sources), won a [[William Henry Rinehart|Rinehart]] [[scholarship|Fellowship]], enabling her to study with [[Norman Carlberg]] [http://www.marylandartsource.org/artists/detail_000000160.html] at the [http://www.mica.edu/PROGRAMS/mfa/rinehart/index.cfm?id=376 Rinehart School of Sculpture], [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. This might seem a sudden and late detour away from painterly pursuits, but it is really a logical step: the canvases in the 1962 Corcoran show, such as &quot;Crags and Crevices&quot; and &quot;Rockscape II&quot; [http://www.askart.com/AskART/photos/KEN20080208_5437/862.jpg][http://www.artfact.com/features/viewArtist.cfm?1=1&amp;searchType=artist&amp;artistRef=P8GCZVSH95], already feature passages that are sculpturally &quot;built up&quot; with thick mounds of [[gesso]] (or &quot;spackle&quot;, as Stanton tends to call it).     The single best source on Jane Frank is ''The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank'' (1968), by Phoebe B. Stanton (the art history professor emerita at [[Johns Hopkins University]] who died in 2003). Stanton's text provides a guide to Jane Frank's life and work, and there is a helpful and liberal use of quotations from the artist herself, enabling the reader to understand how Frank's thinking evolved, especially from the late 1950s through the late 1960s. The book (out of print but still in many public and university art libraries) also contains a wealth of biographical information and many large plate reproductions of the artist's works, some in color. There are also photographs of the artist.    Jane Frank's preoccupation with space was evident even before her paintings became overtly &quot;sculptural&quot; in their use of [[mixed media]]. Of the paintings in the 1962 [[Corcoran Gallery]] show, she tells Phoebe Stanton: &quot;I was trying to pit mass against void and make it look as though there were passages that went way back - that's why 'crevice' is in so many of the titles&quot; (Stanton, p. 15).  Indeed, &quot;Crags and Crevices&quot; (70&quot;x50&quot;, oil and spackle on canvas), completed in 1961, dominated the show. ===Combining diverse materials and techniques=== Soon after the month-long [[Corcoran Gallery]] solo exhibition, Jane Frank began to apply not just spackle but a variety of other materials - sea-weathered or broken glass, charred [[driftwood]], pebbles, what appears to be crushed [[graphite]] or [[silica]], and even glued-on patches of separately painted and encrusted [[canvas]] (canvas [[collage]]) - to her jagged, [[abstract expressionist]] paintings. '''&quot;I wanted work that was painterly but with an actual three-dimensional space&quot;, she later wrote (Yoseloff 1975, pp. 37-39).''' The [[oil painting]] technique itself varies widely, from heavy daubs and stabs of the [[palette knife]] to [[Wash (painting)|watery]] or inky effects. Occasionally a very thick [[impasto]] will be peppered with minute pits, so that it looks a bit like [[sandstone]] eroded by wind-blown dirt. There are even crinkly, web-like areas which somewhat resemble (while clearly not being) [[batique]] or [[tie-dye]]. Sometimes the paint appears smeared with mud or mixed with sand, though it's hard to be sure. The 1963 work pictured at the top of this page is a good example, as is &quot;Plum Point&quot; (1964).  Jane Frank's first solo show at [[New York]]'s [[Bodley Gallery]] (1963), as well as her 1965 solo show at Baltimore's International Gallery, featured many of these radically dense and variegated [[mixed media]] paintings. ===&quot;Apertured&quot;, multiple-canvas paintings=== Later she began making irregular holes  in the canvases (&quot;apertures&quot;, as she called them: the earliest example is &quot;Winter Windows&quot;, 1966&amp;ndash;1967), disclosing deeper layers of painted [[canvas]] underneath (so-called &quot;double canvases&quot; - and sometimes triple canvases), with painted-on &quot;false shadows&quot;, etc. - increasingly invoking the third dimension, creating tactile, sculptural effects while remaining within the convention of the framed, rectangular oil painting. The apertures also suggest a view into some sort of [[psychological]] interior, as though the second canvas - seen only partially, through the hole in the forward canvas - were some half-concealed secret, perhaps even another whole painting that we will never see.   Stanton (p. 24) also notes that Jane Frank worked out a method - unspecified - of stiffening the apertures' often jagged edges so that they held their shape and flatness. These creations are a type of &quot;[[shaped canvas]]&quot;, though obviously very different from the shaped canvases of [[Frank Stella]] and others more commonly associated with this term.  In much of her output before the late 1960s, Frank seems less interested in color than in tonality and texture, often employing the [[grayscale|gray scale]] to create a sense of depth or of motion from light to dark, this frequently moving in a diagonal (as in &quot;Winter's End&quot;, 1958), and otherwise employing one basic [[hue]] (as with the earthy reds in &quot;Plum Point&quot;, 1964). However, the later, &quot;windowed&quot; paintings show a sharper interest in vivid color relationships, especially the &quot;aerial&quot; paintings, of which an early and monumental example is &quot;Aerial View no. 1&quot; (1968, 60 inches by 84 inches, collection of the Turner Auditorium complex at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], [[Johns Hopkins University]]). This was one of the artist's favorites, according to ''Baltimore County Women'' [see below].  ===Standing apart=== While these highly complex and laborious constructions (she often called them &quot;three-dimensional paintings&quot;) moved her well beyond the vocabulary of the improvisatory, so-called &quot;[[action painting]]&quot;  usually associated with American [[abstract expressionism]], they also had virtually nothing to do with the [[pop art]] and [[minimalism]] which were then the rage of the 1960s New York art scene. Furthermore, they bore little resemblance to the serene &quot;[[color field]]&quot; paintings of [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], or [[Mark Rothko]]. Whether brooding or exuberant, the (as it were) geologically deposited, erupted, eroded, and gouged canvases of Jane Frank stand apart from all else. Perhaps this style could be called &quot;geomorphic abstraction&quot; - though apparently no such term can be found as a stylistic category in art history books.  This standoffish [[aesthetic]] position, her chosen departure from the career-making [[New York]] scene, and the fact that her overall output was not very large (by some standards at least), were factors that limited her career and her contemporary impact on the course of [[American art]]. Yet perhaps, as time goes on, present-day art lovers who get to know these pieces will agree with Professor Stanton that they are powerful and beautiful creations, worthy of contemplation and admiration on their intrinsic merits - regardless of what was supposedly fashionable in 1960-something:  {| border=0 style=&quot;background: white&quot; align=center |- |{{cquote|'''...&quot;Winter Windows&quot; is perhaps ''sublime'' in [[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] use of the word for a kind of beauty which produces sensations of awe and helplessness.... Part of the power of these pictures is the result of their controlled design, for balance, color, texture, have been managed so economically that the least change would throw the whole out of key.'''''}} |- align=right |'''??? Dr. Phoebe Stanton''' [''The Sculptural Landscape of Jane Frank'', p. 29]  |}  ==After 1967: sculptures, and further development of the &quot;apertured&quot; paintings== ===Sculpture: depths and shadows, reflections and refractions=== In the late 1960s, Jane Frank turned her energies toward the creation of free-standing [[sculpture]], i.e., sculptures properly speaking, as opposed to &quot;sculptural paintings&quot; or [[mixed media]] works on canvas. Oddly, the Stanton book contains no mention of these, though its chronology (p.31) mentions Jane Frank's 1968 solo show at [[Goucher College]], and the sculptures date from 1967 on, according to Yoseloff's 1975 &quot;Retrospective&quot;. Fortunately, we have [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879820071 &quot;A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s&quot; by Julia M. Busch] (1974), which contains many images of Frank's sculptures, a number in color.   The sculptures, with their clean lines and surfaces, often in sleek [[lucite]] or [[aluminium]], completely dispense with the earthy, gritty qualities of those &quot;sculptural landscape&quot; canvases, yet there seems to be no clear record of Jane Frank's thinking concerning what must have been a sharp divide in her artistic approach and aims. Possibly this simply reflects the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] or [[minimalist]] influence of her teacher, [[Norman Carlberg]]. Indeed, a reviewer of the Watson-Jones book (see References) finds that Frank's sculptures &quot;maintain an abstract cool&quot;. Also, perhaps making the sculptures was a less spontaneous process than [[painting]], placing an emphasis on planning and structure over tactile engagement. Busch (1974) quotes Frank as saying: &quot;I begin [working] from a drawing or cardboard mockup. I give my [[welding]] and [[aluminum]] pieces to a [[machinist]] with whom I work quite closely&quot;. Even if she worked &quot;quite closely&quot; with the [[machinist]], this is clearly a very different creative process from solitary work in the studio. Nevertheless, to this writer, a palpable common element between the sculptural paintings and the free-standing sculptures seems to be a fascination with depth and shadows. She seems concerned with what happens to light when it encounters obstacles. Rather than monumental forms, imposing themselves on a space, most of Jane Frank's sculptures seem more like [[Dreamcatcher (Native American)|dreamcatcher]]s: ingenious contraptions designed to seize fugitive visions, so that we can get a better look at them. This is further suggested by many of the titles, such as &quot;April Screen&quot;, &quot;[[Prism]] no. 2&quot;, and &quot;Shadows of Substance&quot;. '''Julia M. Busch also calls attention to this quality with her remark that &quot;Jane Frank's [[Acrylic glass|acrylic]] constructions cast brilliant [[stained-glass]] shadows through the play of light and color&quot; (p. 26).''' Busch classifies Frank's pieces as [[environmental sculpture]] - a type pioneered by [[Louise Nevelson]].  There were more solo exhibitions, at venues including [[New York]]'s [[Bodley Gallery]] again in 1967, [[Morgan State University]] (1967), [[Goucher College]] (for the second time) in 1968, [[London]]'s Alwin Gallery in 1971, the Galerie de l'Universit??, [[Paris]] (1972), the [[Philadelphia]] Art Alliance (1975), and a major retrospective at Towson State College (now [[Towson University]]) in 1975. She also won the Sculpture Prize at the 1983 Maryland Artists Exhibition (source: Watson-Jones).  ===Aerial landscape paintings=== Even after 1967, when Jane Frank began making sculptures, grappling with new media such as plastics and metals, she maintained her ever-evolving production of [[mixed media]] paintings on [[canvas]], virtually until the end of her life. Continuing her exploration of the possibilities of multiple-canvas, &quot;apertured&quot; paintings, she began to create her &quot;[[Aerial landscape art|Aerial]] Series&quot; pieces, which came more and more explicitly to suggest [[landscapes]] seen from above. Especially noteworthy and striking are the &quot;Night Landings&quot; paintings, such as &quot;Night Landings: Sambura&quot; (1970), with the city grid glinting below like a dark jewel in a deep, nocturnal blue river valley. The 1975 Yoseloff retrospective catalogue listed below is very illuminating on these latter developments, and the color plates (which include images of some of the sculptures) are of higher quality than those in the Stanton book.  Several sources note that Jane Frank also designed [[rugs]] and [[tapestries]]; a color photograph showing a detail from one of these [[textile]] works is reproduced in the Ann Avery book listed below.  Jane Frank died on Saturday, [[May 31]], [[1986]]. In some sources, her place of residence is listed as [[Owings Mills, Maryland]], which is a near suburb of [[Baltimore]]. The 1986 Watson-Jones book's entry on Jane Frank, available at the &quot;Questia&quot; link given below, states her address as &quot;1300 Woods Hole Road [[Towson, Maryland]] 21204&quot;. [[Towson]] is another near suburb of Baltimore.  ==Concluding discussion of Jane Frank's work as a whole== ===&quot;Standing in the presence of the gods&quot;=== [[Image:Jane Frank standing.jpg|left|thumb]]  The overall characterization of Jane Frank's art is ultimately a subjective matter, but there is plenty of solid material on which to base a substantive discussion.  There is a strong feeling of the [[solitarian]] in many of these pieces before 1970. They are wild and unpeopled. It is ironic that someone trained in [[advertising]] and [[acting]] would create such an emphatically unsocial body of work. Thus Stanton writes that &quot;[[landscape]]&quot; is for Jane Frank a way of conveying ideas which (to Stanton) recall [[Heidigger]]'s definition of [[poetry]], which included '''&quot;the recreation of the experience of standing 'in the presence of the gods and to be exposed to the essential proximity of things' &quot; (Stanton, p.8).''' According to the jacket notes of the Stanton book, ''Pictures on Exhibit'' magazine commented in a similar vein, saying that these landscapes are '''&quot;to a compellingly strong degree, poetic evocations of communion with Nature's basic essentials&quot;.''' We are in direct contact with the primal forces, exposed and profoundly alone.  These works are at once sensually compelling and incorporeal ??? &quot;out-of-body&quot;, so to speak. And as Julia M. Busch points out, even the sculptures avoid reference to anything recognizably, bodily human. Stating that Frank's sculptures are &quot;environmental&quot;, Busch goes on to define this term in a way that points to their &quot;beyond-human&quot; quality:  '''&quot;[[Environmental sculpture]] is never made to work at exactly human scale, but is sufficiently larger or smaller than scale to avoid confusion with the human image in the eyes of the viewer.&quot; (Busch, p. 27).'''  [[Image:Jane Frank Sculpture New Moon.jpg|left|thumb|Jane Frank: &quot;New Moon&quot;, acrylic and aluminum, 1967]]Also, the canvases of the 1960s, for all their [[landscape]]-like qualities, usually avoid anything that can be read as a horizon or a sky: we literally don't know which way is up; for as Stanton (p. 12) points out,  Jane Frank - starting with &quot;Winter's End&quot; (1958) - avoids horizontal orientation in favor of strong diagonals. Furthermore, in this painting, as in many others of the next decade, scale is undecidable. Stanton, again speaking of &quot;Winter's End&quot;, writes:  '''&quot;One is given no indication of the size of the scene; the way through which winter passes could be either a mountain gorge or a minute water course&quot; (Stanton 1968, p. 12).'''  Plenty of cues are there that this is some sort of [[landscape]], and Frank herself avows it:  '''&quot;The beginning of my efforts to make my own statement, I would trace to my first visit to the [[Phillips Collection|Phillips Gallery]].... [[Landscape]] was a natural [[metaphor]], and so it is still for me today, in my three-dimensional double canvases&quot; (Jane Frank, in a letter to Yoseloff, quoted in Yoseloff, 1975, p. 37).'''  Summing up the ambiguous position of Jane Frank's work on canvas with respect to both landscape art and pure abstraction, a reviewer for ''The Art Gallery'' magazine  wrote of her 1971 solo show at London's Alwin Gallery: &quot;Her richly textured canvases evoke a world of crags and forests, rivers and plains, in terms which are entirely non-representational.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Her+richly+textured+canvases+evoke+a+world+of+crags+and+forests%2C+rivers+and+plains%2C+in+terms+which+are+entirely+non-representational%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books]  The catalogue of the 1963 Bodley Gallery show contains a long essay by the artist, and the following three quoted passages capture many of the concerns described here:   (1) On constructing her metaphorical landscape vocabulary: '''&quot;I prefer to create my own landscapes or vocabulary of shapes and patterns. However, it is rock and mineral substances, their veins and surfaces, projections and infinite hollows, which spark my particular fantasy - also beach wood, well worn with time, that is to be found on the water's edge. Issues of space have always been one of my prime concerns, and these substances seem to relate most closely to this concern. These then are the metaphor...&quot;'''    (2) On the quality of interiority in her works: '''&quot;It is also an attempt to penetrate the surface of an object, presenting not only the outside but what occurs within - the essence or core.&quot;'''  (3) On the essential aloneness of her vision: '''&quot;The artist must create his own space, of his own time and personal vision. The result is not a unique image for the sake of 'newness', but rather for the sake of the artist, who must be concerned with it daily. These days are spent quite alone.&quot;'''  These pieces of the late 1950s and 1960s never lapse into the complaisantly decorative: there is a certain deliberate instability, often even violence, that prevents that. This quality comes through in another remark from Dr. Stanton's book. She's speaking of &quot;Crags and Crevices&quot;, but it fits many of the works: ''' &quot;Nothing in the painting is still, for the big forms seem to hover in mid-air, colliding as they fall. There are provocative and startling contrasts between passages of thin, transparent paint and thick [[impasto]], filled with striatures left by the [[palette knife]].&quot;  (Stanton, p.14).'''  ===Delighting in the bird's-eye view===  Even 1968's &quot;Aerial View No. 1&quot;, despite the spatial hint of the title, is far from literal. Certain features of structure and color render a literal interpretation of this image as an aerial landscape difficult or even impossible. The attempt at interpretation is both invited and repulsed. But by about 1970, with the &quot;Night Landings&quot; paintings, there was a definite shift away from the previous decade's stubbornly refractive attitude. The &quot;Night Landings&quot; offer a much more definite sense of scale and viewpoint, especially with the aid of the titles. &quot;Night Landings: [[Nairobi]]&quot; is not disorienting in the least: we know where we are; we know we're in a plane, we know the plane is landing, and we even know roughly what time it is: we are looking down, and we see vividly the city named in the title, with the surrounding land and water.   Furthermore, the fact that we see a city down there means that - at least implicitly - there are ''people'' in this painting.  Yoseloff, in his 1975 &quot;Retrospective&quot; book, enthuses:  '''&quot;Perhaps the ultimate achievement in the direction in which Mrs. Frank has been tending is her series of &quot;night landings&quot;.... Now, more than ever, the viewer is deeply involved, and he can feel himself carried downward into the [[landscape]] that is the canvas before him&quot; (Thomas Yoseloff, &quot;Jane Frank: A Retrospective Exhibition&quot;, 1975: pp.18-20).'''  A staunch [[modernist]] might scoff that with the &quot;Night Landings&quot; of 1970 Jane Frank's art begins to [[do not go gentle into that good night|&quot;go gentle into that good night&quot;]] (perhaps even lapsing into &quot;[[postmodernism]]&quot;). But if these more literal [[aerial landscape]]s - created in 1970 and after - lose some of the tension that gives the earlier paintings their distinctive power, they nevertheless address, with an intensely intimate delight, a perspective on reality which we must remember was still quite young in 1970, at least as a painterly subject. In &quot;Aerial Perception&quot; (1985), author Margret Dreikausen sees Jane Frank's [[aerial landscape]]s as sharing the spirit of the work of artists such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Susan Crile]], and others, in creating images which &quot;reflect contemporary interest in reality&quot;, experienced from a historically new vantage point. '''Dreikausen insists that this art &quot;does not merely show landscape from the air&quot; but incorporates the &quot;earthbound vision&quot; into &quot;remembered images from both spaces&quot;[p.63].''' Dreikausen also (p. 27) sees Jane Frank's aerial paintings as consisting of two basic types: the &quot;day scenes&quot; (such as &quot;Ledge of Light&quot;) and the &quot;night landings&quot; (such as &quot;Night Landing: Sambura&quot;).  The day scenes show a fascination with the play of actual shadows and false, painted ones, '''&quot;inviting the viewer more closely to inspect the textures on the canvas and its 'reality' &quot;(p.27).''' In the night landings, by contrast, the city is the focus, nestled in the canvas's aperture, like a precious jewel in a dark velvet box, with its '''&quot;enticing twinkling lights&quot;, suggesting &quot;the anticipation of the unknown, mysterious city.... The use of beads and glitter, partially covered with paint, conveys a sense of personal landscape&quot; (p27).'''   [N.B.: Yoseloff, 1975, gives the reverse of Dreikausen's dates for these two works: that is, he gives 1970 as the date for &quot;Night Landing: Sambura&quot; (not 1974) and 1974 as the date for &quot;Ledge of Light&quot; (not 1970). Yoseloff's dates seem to comport better with other information, and so it seems probable that Dreikausen somehow got them reversed.]  ===Art of the lonely inscape===  &lt;!-- [[Image:Jane Frank thmb square.jpg|thumb|'''Jane Frank''']] --&gt; The 1999 Benezit book's entry on Jane Frank takes it as a given that her works on canvas may be summarized as semi-abstract aerial views: '''&quot;Sa peinture, abstraite, fait cependant reference a un paysagisme aerien, comme vu d'avion.&quot; [&quot;Her paintings, though abstract, nevertheless make reference to [[aerial landscape]]s, as viewed from an airplane.&quot;''']  As an overview of Jane Frank's work, this oversimplifies - even to the point of falsification; but it must be remembered that Frank did not exhibit in [[Paris]] until 1972. The French, ''ainsi dire'', got only a distant, aerial view of Jane Frank's ''oeuvre''. One really ought to come in for a closer look; for despite the relatively extroverted character of these later aerial paintings, the continued use of multiple canvases with apertures gives even these more realistic landscapes an unsettling quality of psychic ingazing: thus, her obituary in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' (Monday, [[June 2]], [[1986]]) reminds us that she liked to call her works &quot;[[Inscape (visual art)|inscape]]s&quot;. As we peer over crags into the abyss, we are - in the words of Dr. Stanton - '''&quot;exposed to the essential proximity of things.&quot;'''  ==See also== {{col-begin}} {{col-break}} *[[Abstract expressionism]] *[[Aerial landscape art]] *[[Bodley Gallery]] *[[Environmental sculpture]] {{col-break}} *[[Hans Hofmann]] *[[Inscape (visual art)]] *[[Shaped canvas]] *[[Landscape art]] {{col-break}} *[[Maryland Institute College of Art]] *[[Minimalism]] *[[Mixed media]] *[[Norman Carlberg]] {{col-break}} *[[Park School of Baltimore]] *[[Parsons The New School for Design]] *[[Women artists]] {{col-end}}  ==References== ===Books===  1.

Remember that the free-standing sculptures - as opposed to the &quot;sculptural paintings&quot; - do not become an important part of Jane Frank's output until the late 1960s. Consequently,  for example, under 'Selected Individual Exhibitions', the sculpture-oriented bio includes neither the 1958 solo exhibition at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] nor the 1962 [[Corcoran Gallery]] solo exhibition  - for these were entirely exhibitions of paintings, not sculpture. On the other hand, the best thing about the Watson-Jones bio is that it tracks Jane Frank's career into the 1980s, whereas the Phoebe Stanton monograph takes us only to 1968, and the Busch and Yoseloff books only get us up to the early to mid 1970s.

	(int) 47 => 'Watermelon War -> {{Unreferenced|date=July 2007}}  The '''Watermelon War''' was a riot that occurred in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], on the morning of [[April 15]] [[1856]].  ==Background== From 1850 until 1903, the [[US military]] had created very strong tension between Panamanian citizens and US officials.  The tension brewed until massive race riots and [[revolt]]s appeared all over Panama, creating turmoil in an already battered nation.  During this time, many Panamanian citizens despised the American citizens because they felt as if the US had dominated the labor force.  Panamanians that once held jobs were left unemployed, because once the U.S. completed the trans-Panama railroad, they terminated the entire labor force.  The U.S. then filled the administrative and supervisory roles with Americans, while only a few jobs were left for the Panamanians on the [[railroad]] lines.  During this railroad boom, many U.S. citizens were seen passing through Panama City, and with the animosity brewing, a riot was inevitable.  ==The Riot== On that particular April morning the U.S. [[Steamboat|steamer]], John L. Stephens, transported about 1,000 passengers to Panama City.  However, the station was located at the waterfront and Panama City did not then have any [[wharf]]s where ships could dock.  Therefore, ships like John L. Stephens had to dock on a surrounding island, in this case [[Taboga Island]], and then be ferried to Panama City.  The passengers could only be ferried during high tide and, on this particular day, the John L. Stephens arrived during low tide; therefore, the passengers had to sit and wait on [[high tide]].    Most of the passengers were drunk by this time because many of them had visited the local cantinas before the trip.  One very drunk and arrogant American, Jack Oliver, decided to walk around the station and encountered a vendor selling [[watermelon]].  Oliver grabbed a slice of the watermelon, which was priced at five cents per slice, and refused to pay for it.  The vendor yelled at Oliver and eventually pulled out a [[knife]] and threatened him.  One of Oliver???s friends then tossed five cents at the vendor, but the vendor continued yelling at Oliver until Oliver pulled out a [[gun]].  At this point the vendor took off running, but another Panamanian, who saw the entire incident, grabbed Oliver???s arm and the two struggled for the gun. During this struggle, the gun went off and a bystander was wounded.  At this point, the riot was unavoidable as more Panimanians arrived and more shots began to be fired.  Many Americans were beaten unmercifully, robbed, and many buildings were destroyed.  When the police arrived later, one of them was hit by a [[bullet]], which forced them to join in the riot.  Everyone in the area, even the [[police]] and authority figures, were involved in the Watermelon War.  Finally, a [[train]] arrived filled with armed railroad men, who were led by [[Randolph Runnels]].  The railroad men then fired at the [[crowd|mob]] and most of them ran for cover.  Runnels then shouted to the mob to put down the weapons and come out with their hands over their heads.  In the end, Governor Ani??o, submitted an official report that stated 15 Americans were dead and 16 wounded, and 2 Panamanians were dead and 13 wounded  ==Consequences==  On July 18, the American commissioner, [[Amos Corwine]], recommended in his report &quot; ... the immediate occupation of the isthmus.&quot; This raised a series of diplomatic controversies.  Accordingly, the North American authorities attended to the report and on September, 1856 American troops unlawfully invaded Panama disembarking in the isthmus and taking the railway station.  On September 19 of that year, a detachment of 160 soldiers took possession of the railway station. The city was calm and three days later, the troops moved back without having fired a single shot. This brief occupation was supposedly justified according to the U.S. government by a clause in the Agreement of 1846, by means of which, the United States was guaranteeing the neutrality of the isthmus, so that transit was not interrupted.  ===Proposal===  Taking advantage for their own benefit the United States made the following proposals:  1. That the city of [[Panama City|Panama]] and [[Col??n, Panama|Col??n]] had to be free cities and that they were governed under the sovereignty of Panama, and jointly they will control a strip land twenty miles wide from ocean to ocean, with the railroad as the central line.  2. Panama had to transfer several islands in the [[Bay of Panama]] to the United States to use them as naval bases.  3. Panama had to transfer its rights on the Panamanian Railroad to the United States   4. Panama had to pay compensation for damages for the loss of life and the destruction of property.  ===Compensation===  Finally the government of Panama accepted the terms and signed the [[Herr??n-Cass]] Agreement.  On September 10, 1857 the Panamanian government established a sum compensation of $412.394 in gold for damages.  * 195.410 dollars for indemnifications derived from the riot. * 65.070 dollars for new claims. * 9.277 dollars for expenses of the commissioners * 142.637 dollars for interests.  The United States was not alone in demanding indemnifications, France and England, whose citizens turned out to be affected as well, also demanded compensation.  In turn, the United States used this incident as an excuse to put Article 35 of the Mallarino-Bidlack Agreement into practice.  That is to say, its prerogative of safeguarding the neutrality and free transit in Panama, and use of armed forces when the local government is deemed unfit.  This motivated a series of American interventions in the isthmus during the 19th and 20th century, which at last irritated the xenophobia and the nationalistic feeling of the Panamanians.  According to the Gazette of the State of May 3, 1856, the dead persons were Lucas Prados and Apolinar N. of Panama; and Robert Marks, of Pennsylvania; Octavio Dubois, French; N. Stokes, of the filibusters of [[William Walker (soldier)]]; Alexander Sweet, of Maine and another 12 of whom the names are not known.

First flying in [[1917]], it was designed as a two-seat trainer for the [[United States Army]], then adopted by the [[United States Navy]] as its very first [[fighter aircraft]]. In [[1922]], a VE-7 became the first plane to take off from an American [[aircraft carrier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fighters&quot;&gt;[Lloyd S. Jones, ''U.S. Naval Fighters'' (Fallbrook CA: Aero Publishers, 1977, ISBN 0-8168-9254-7), pp. 11-13]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Design and development== The [[Lewis &amp; Vought Corporation]] was formed just months after the US entered [[World War I]], with the intention of servicing war needs. The company's trainer was patterned after successful European designs; for instance, the engine was a Wright [[Hispano Suiza]] of the type used by the French [[Spad]]s. In practice, the VE-7's performance was much better than usual for a trainer, and comparable to the best fighters, and the Army ordered 1,000 of an improved design called the VE-8. However, the contract was cancelled due to the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;fighters&quot;&gt;[Lloyd S. Jones, ''U.S. Naval Fighters'' (Fallbrook CA: Aero Publishers, 1977, ISBN 0-8168-9254-7), pp. 11-13]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Navy was very interested in the VE-7, and received a first machine in May 1920. Production orders soon followed, in fact beyond what the fledgling Vought organization could handle, and the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] was pressed into service. In all 128 VE-7s were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;fighters&quot;&gt;[Lloyd S.

It was a single-seater, the front cockpit being faired over and a Vickers .30 cal. machine gun mounted over it, on the left side and synchronized to fire through the propeller. Some planes, designated VE-7SF, had flotation gear consisting of inflatable bags stowed away, available to help keep the plane afloat when [[ditching]] at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;fighters&quot;&gt;[Lloyd S.

On [[November 29]], [[1823]], she married the future King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] and supported his intellectual interests, namely his attempts at artwork, which he held dear to his heart.  In 1830, Elisabeth converted to [[Protestantism]].  Becoming Queen consort of Prussia in 1840, she was never without influence in Prussian politics, where she was active in preserving the close friendship between Prussia and the [[Austrian Empire]].  To Frederick William IV, she was an exemplary wife and, during his long illness, a dedicated nurse.  After his death on [[January 2]], [[1861]], Elisabeth lived quietly at her seats at [[Sanssouci]], [[Charlottenburg]], and [[Stolzenfels]] and dedicated herself to charity work in memory of her late husband .

His art, always grounded in [[Realism (art)|realism]], shows connections to [[symbolism]] and [[Surrealism (art)|surrealism]].  Dickinson was born and raised in upstate [[New York State|New York]], in the [[Finger Lakes]] area; his family moved to [[Buffalo, NY|Buffalo]] in 1897. The death of his mother from [[tuberculosis]] in 1903, the suicide in 1913 of his older brother, Burgess, and his father's remarriage in 1914 to a much younger woman have all been cited as influences on the themes of his later work.&lt;ref&gt;Dreishpoon, et al., 2002, pp. 54???55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dickinson had youthful ambitions for a career in the [[United States Navy|Navy]], but he failed the Navy entrance exam twice (though he later served as a radio operator during [[World War I]]). In 1911 he enrolled at the [[Art Students League of New York]], where he studied under [[William Merritt Chase]]. In the summers of 1912 and 1913 he stayed in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], where he took a class taught by [[Charles Webster Hawthorne|Charles W. Hawthorne]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreishpoon, et al., 2002, pp. 210???211.&lt;/ref&gt; After concluding his formal studies in 1913, Dickinson  lived and taught in Provincetown for several years.  His mature paintings can be roughly divided into two categories: The first consists of [[portrait]]s, [[still life]]s and [[Landscape art|landscapes]] executed quickly, often at a single sitting (the artist referred to these as ''premiere coups''); the second is comprised of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]s of symbolic and enigmatic character, often large in size and very complex, which sometimes took many years to complete. While his palette tended towards monochrome, his landscapes painted from observation are notable for their strong evocation of light, which is usually hazy but sometimes brilliant. His paintings are often allusively autobiographical in content.  His drawings in graphite are notable for their sensitivity to tonal nuance.  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  ==References== *Dreishpoon, Douglas (et al) (2002). ''Edwin Dickinson: Dreams and Realities''.

The Tabernacle was converted in the mid-1980s from a [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] chapel into a centre for the [[performing arts]]. Since then the Museum of Modern Art has grown up alongside it, with six exhibition spaces.  The [[Auditorium]] of The Tabernacle has excellent [[acoustics]] and [[Pitch Pine]] pews to seat 350 people. [[Chamber music|Chamber]] and [[Choir|choral]] music, [[Drama (art form)|drama]], [[lecture]]s and [[:wikt:conference|conferences]] regularly take place here. A [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] [[grand piano]] has been purchased; translation booths, recording facilities and a [[Movie theater|cinema]] screen have been installed; the oak-beamed Foyer has a [[bar]]; and extensive access for the disabled has been made possible by a lift.  The [[Machynlleth Festival]] takes place in the Auditorium in late August every year. During the week eminent performers take part in events ranging from recitals for children to [[jazz]]. Special features are the [[Hallstatt Lecture]] on some aspect of [[Culture of Wales|Celtic culture]] and the [[Glyndwr Award]] for an Outstanding Contribution to the [[Arts]] in Wales.  For the rest of the year the centre can be hired for performances, rehearsals and gatherings. Ty Llyfnant houses music teaching rooms and an art studio while the Green Room doubles as a Language Laboratory where [[Lifelong learning]] classes are held.   ==Exhibitions== Throughout the year MOMA shows ''Modern Welsh Art'', a constantly changing exhibition featuring leading [[artist]]s from Wales. Individual artists are spotlighted in a series of temporary exhibitions. In August expert judges and then the public choose the winners of the [[Tabernacle Art Competition]].  ==The Tabernacle Collection== Paintings and drawings from the [[Tabernacle Collection]] are shown in rotation. Works in this permanent collection include ''Portrait of William McElroy'' by [[Augustus John]], ''Toasting'' by [[Stanley Spencer]] and ''Portrait of a Woman'' by Percy [[Wyndham Lewis]]. MOMA Wales owns ''Waterfall, Ogwen'', ''Cottages, Cilgwyn'', ''Carreg Cennen'' and ''Road above Deiniolen'' by Sir [[Kyffin Williams]]. The [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] is represented by Graham Arnold's ''Last Poems (A E Housman)'' and ''Journal 1997'' and by Ann Arnold's ''Clare's Countryside'' (8) and ''The River Dyfi''. There are also two drawings of [[Dylan Thomas]] by his friend [[Mervyn Levy]].  [[Peter Prendergast]] (''Early Winter, Nant Ffrancon Valley'' and ''Study for Early Winter, Nant Ffrancon Valley'') received the Glyndwr Award in 2004, while [[Shani Rhys James]] (''Night Kitchen I'') is the designated recipient for 2007.  ==Further reading== * Mike Parker &amp; Paul Whitfield: ''The Rough Guide to Wales'' (Rough Guides, London, 2003) ISBN 978-1-84353-120-3 * [[Alistair Crawford]]: ''Made of Wales'' (Machynlleth Tabernacle Trust, Machynlleth, 2000) ISBN 978-0-9519971-3-0 * Paul Binding: ''A commemorative essay commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, Wales for the 20th anniversary of The Brotherhood of Ruralists'' (Machynlleth Tabernacle Trust, Machynlleth, 1995) * David Alston, Lynda Morris &amp; Tony Curtis: ''The Painter's Quarry: The Art of Peter Prendergast'' (Seren, Bridgend, 2006) ISBN 978-1-85411-409-9 * Shani Rhys James: ''The Black Cot'' (Gomer, Llandysul, 2004) ISBN 978-1-84323-152-3 * [[Walter Michel]]: ''Wyndham Lewis: paintings and drawings'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1971) ISBN 978-0-520-01612-5  ==External links== * [http://www.momawales.org.uk Official site in Welsh and English] * [http://www.artinwales.250x.com Contemporary Artists in Wales]  {{Musems and art galleries in Wales}}  [[Category:Buildings and structures in Wales]] [[Category:Museums in Wales]] [[Category:Performing arts in Wales]] [[Category:Modern art museums]] [[Category:Art museums and galleries in Wales]] [[Category:Welsh art]];',

Replays showed that a defender was caught out of place on an offside trap.

Referee [[Wolfgang Stark]] was criticized by the Chilean players for his officiating, having &quot;lost control of the match early&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/238024 TheStar.com | Sports | Beautiful game turns ugly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and for issuing seven [[yellow card]]s (out of nine) and two [[red card]]s against the Chilean team during the match&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/matches/round=249411/match=58893/statistics.html FIFA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. In total he issued 53 fouls, 30 of which he charged to Chile.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/07/20/bc.soc.u20.chilefight.ap/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 23 to Argentina.   Chilean striker [[Nicol??s Medina (Chilean footballer)|Nicol??s Medina]] hinted that he felt that the referee was favoring the Argentine team, stating that &quot;Eleven against eleven, the game would have been much more fair.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;metronews&quot;&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/story.aspx?id=63556 Argentina dives to finals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. Added to this is the perception that the Argentine players were able to employ &quot;diving&quot; tactics and &quot;theatrics&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;metronews&quot; /&gt; to influence the referee's calls. However, before the game the Chilean players had suffered from a lot of pressure imposed by their own national media who saw a victory against Argentina as a national priority and described the match as a war more than as a normal confrontation between two football teams. Probably because of that pressure, the Chilean players started to lose their self-control on the field very early and resorted to putting constant pressure on Stark by systematically challenging every single one of his decisions. During one of those heated arguments, a Chilean fan invaded the pitch and attempted to physically assault the referee. The abusive fan had to be restrained by the Canadian police and even by some members of the Chilean squad.   Following the match, Stark and his colleagues were surrounded by livid Chilean players who were restrained by members of the [[Toronto Police]]. Stark then had to be escorted off of the pitch and into the dressing room tunnel by police officers for fear that he would be attacked by the crowd and/or Chilean players at the [[BMO Field|National Soccer Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/fifau20/story/2007/07/19/fifa-u20-argentina-chile.html Argentina advances to FIFA U-20 final - FIFA U-20 - Sports - CBC.ca&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   Afterwards, several players and delegates of the Chilean team were involved in a brawl with [[Toronto Police Service|police]] outside [[Toronto]]'s [[BMO Field|National Soccer Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;[Reuters: ''Chile soccer players clash with Toronto police''; July 20, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; which ended with several Chileans injured, then handcuffed and detained inside the stadium. How the events unfolded is not unanimous, with two currently existing versions.  ====Players' version==== According to the Chilean players and some witnesses, at 10:22 p.m. (local time) Chilean player [[Isa??as Peralta]] ??? before getting on the team bus ??? walked towards a crowd of Chilean fans stationed behind a security fence some 50 metres away from the bus, but was stopped by about ten policemen some 30 metres away from the fence. A heated discussion took place, where Peralta (who speaks no English) was verbally and physically abused by the policemen. Peralta was [[taser]]ed by one police officer and he lost consciousness for 20 minutes. Chilean player [[Arturo Vidal]] arrived at the scene to help his team mate and got involved in a struggle with the police. Other eyewitnesses stated it was Chilean goalkeeper [[Cristopher Toselli]] who walked towards the fans when he was grabbed by a security guard, prompting the melee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/239050 Campbell, Morgan; ''Toronto Star'': CSA seeking witnesses to Chile brawl; July 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; This was noticed by the other players inside the bus, who also got involved in the struggle with the police. All players ??? except Peralta, who lay unconscious on the ground ??? got back on the bus and closed the doors to keep the police out. A policewoman noticed this and threw a [[tear gas]] canister (or something to that effect) inside the bus. The players panicked and started breaking windows to let air in. Three minutes later the president of the Chilean National Association of Professional Football (ANFP), [[Harold Mayne-Nicholls]], asked the players to descend from the bus to take a different one. As the players were getting off the bus they were violently detained by police; some players were even handcuffed. [[Alexis S??nchez]] ??? who was coming out of the [[antidoping]] test ??? heard some people screaming and arrived at the scene, but was also beaten by police. The police then took the players back to the stadium. Christian Su??rez &amp;ndash; arriving from the mixed zone &amp;ndash; was also detained.&lt;ref name=&quot;latercera21&quot;&gt;''[http://papeldigital.info/lt/edicion.html?20070721010011 La Tercera]'' [[July 21]] [[2007]] edition&lt;/ref&gt; Peralta claimed that after he regained consciousness: &quot;I saw 10 police officers were hitting me and throwing acid in my face;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV&quot; /&gt; and also claimed the police removed an object the size of a match from his back so the press wouldn't be able to see it.&lt;ref name=&quot;emol&quot;&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=263142 Sub 20: Los jugadores contaron su impactante versi??n de los hechos]&quot;, ''El Mercurio Online'', ''agencias'', accessed [[July 21]] [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Chilean players said to the Chilean press that the Canadian police treated them like criminals, used [[pepper spray]] and Tasers on them, threatened them with legal action, and that while they were on the team's dressing room showing each others wounds, they were laughed at.&lt;ref name=&quot;emol&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latercera21&quot;/&gt; During the Sunday final Mayne-Nicholls &amp;ndash; who is also a FIFA official &amp;ndash; allegedly identified the policeman who gave the order to use gas on the players and asked him why he had acted that way; Mayne-Nicholls claimed the policeman responded: &quot;We use gas and electricity when we deal with criminals like yours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.tercera.com/medio/articulo/0,0,3308_5804_284310993,00.html Mayne-Nicholls relat?? in??ditos detalles de golpiza en Canad??]&quot; ''[[La Tercera]]'', accessed on [[July 24]] [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ====Police version==== The police version of the events, as given by Toronto Police Chief [[Bill Blair (police chief)|Bill Blair]], claimed that the melee began when Chilean players got into a scuffle with a rival fan.&lt;ref name=&quot;policedefence&quot;&gt;[http://www.tsn.ca/soccer/news_story/?ID=214113&amp;hubname= Chilean officials blame Police for melee], tsn.ca, accessed [[July 20]] [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; He added that &quot;members of the Chilean team then decided to direct some of their aggressive behaviour towards my officers...

	(int) 64 => 'Snowball marches -> [[Image:BoomerangsForbes1916.jpg|thumb|300px|The Boomerangs at Forbes]]During [[World War I]], '''recruitment marches'''  or '''snowball marches''' to [[Sydney]] were a feature of volunteer recruiting drives for the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in rural [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].  Between October 1915 and February 1916, nine marches were held starting from various points in the state; the most notable was the first march from Gilgandra, known as the Cooee march. There was also a similar march in south-eastern Queensland.  In 1918, in an effort to promote recruitment, another march was staged, but this was less spontaneous and the marchers in fact traveled by train.  The marches were called &quot;snowball marches&quot; in the hope that like a [[snowball effect|snowball rolling down a hill]] will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow as it rolls along, the marchers would also collect more marchers as they progressed to the recruiting depot.  == Background == The [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] was formed promptly on the declaration of [[World War I]] as a volunteer force; many men signed up immediately. From mid-June 1915 there was a substantial increase in recruitment, as state-based Parliamentary recruiting committees were formed and became active in towns, boroughs and shires.  In June 1915 the [[George Pearce|Minister for Defense]] set recruitment goals at 5,300 men per month in order to maintain the forces fighting at [[Gallipoli]].   This target was exceeded in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] when 21,698 men enlisted in that month, the largest number from any state during the war. The campaign in New South Wales by contrast was disappointing for state leaders ??? especially so in light of interstate rivalry between the two neighbors. &lt;!-- what were these initial disappointing recruitment numbers?--&gt; It was suggested by the [[Premiers of New South Wales|Premier of New South Wales]], [[William Holman]], that one of the reasons New South Wales was not meeting the targets was because the military authorities were not ready to accept the men at the time they offered to enlist and told them to come back later. &lt;!-- who was he, he was the leader of the Government of the State of NSW- was this true or was he making excuses for poor NSW recruiting numbers?  I suspect that it was indeed true but I am surprised that the practice was limited to NSW and should not have accounted for the difference in recruitment rates between states--&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;RobsonAIFRecruitment&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Robson | first = L.L. | authorlink = Leslie Lloyd Robson  | year = 1970, paperback 1982 | title = The First A.I.F.: A study of its recruitment 1914-1918 | publisher = Melbourne University Press | location = Carlton, Victoria, Australia | id = ISBN 0-522-84237-2 |pages=p. 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to these embarrassing recruitment shortfalls, some New South Wales residents launched a series of '[[snowball effect|snowball]]' recruiting marches, which were intended to encourage men to enlist through the marchers' example.  The first march was a locally based initiative led by the captain of the local [[Rifle Club]] in October 1915; eight other marches were known to have taken place over the next four months. Military authorities were initially ambivalent about the marches; they were not certain whether or not the men should march with rifles, when their pay would start, and who would clothe or feed them.  Along the route however, local communities fed and housed the men, and the marches gained tremendous publicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobsonAIFRecruitment&quot;/&gt; About 1,500 men marched in total, and they are credited by some sources with persuading anywhere from two to three times that number to enlist as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobsonAIFRecruitment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref  name=&quot;AWMRcrtngMarches&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/recruiting_march/index.htm  | title = Recruiting Marches 1915-1916 | work = Australian War Memorial Encyclopaedia | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2006-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- any after-effects or other retrospective analysis? what happened after 1916?

They marched via [[Harefield, New South Wales|Harefield]], [[Junee, New South Wales|Junee]], [[Illabo, New South Wales|Illabo]], [[Bethungra, New South Wales|Bethungra]], [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] and [[Wallendbeen, New South Wales|Wallendbeen]]. At Wallendbeen on [[December 9]], the Governor-General addressed the marchers.  After Wallendbeen, they marched via [[Nubba, New South Wales|Nubba]] to [[Murrumburrah, New South Wales|Murrumburrah]] and the next day they were at [[Harden, New South Wales|Harden]]. They then marched through [[Galong, New South Wales|Galong]], [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]] and [[Bowning, New South Wales|Bowning]] to [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].  From Wagga Wagga to Yass was a total of  132 miles, the march travelled at an average of 8.8 miles per day.  As with other marches, the men were fed and feted by the local population; at Murrumburrah, for instance, donations included 114 puddings and 9 sheep to be baked gratis by the local bakers, 200 loaves of bread, 850 potatoes and 30 dozen eggs.  They marched to [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] via [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]. The Kangaroo recruits travelled from Campbelltown into Sydney by train arriving on [[7 January]] [[1916]] with somewhere between 210 and 230 recruits. It had been decided that this recruitment drive would finish at Campbelltown so that a country contingent could be created. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woolaroo.com.au/yassarmistice/kangaroo.htm Yass remembers 1918 - Recruiting soldiers - The 1915 Kangaroo March&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of rowdy and drunken behaviour along the route by the marchers.

Marching under the 'Men from Snowy River' banner (now housed in the Western Front gallery at the Australian War Memorial), the recruitment march passed through the major regional centres of the [[Monaro]], with civil receptions at [[Bombala, New South Wales|Bombala]], [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]], [[Bungendore, New South Wales|Bungendore]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/recruiting_march/snowy.htm| title = Men from Snowy River recruiting march | work = Australian War Memorial Encyclopaedia | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although volunteers joined the 'Snowies' as they passed through smaller towns and villages, massive civil receptions at the larger centres celebratised the 'Snowy' recruits, which was intended to entice further 'eligibles' at the meetings to do likewise. Such was the case with recruit Timothy McMahon, who despite volunteering to march with the Men from Snowy River at [[Michelago, New South Wales|Michelago]], was employed by recruiting staff to dramatically 'volunteer' at several of these receptions in order to appeal to the patriotism of the crowd, and lure other volunteers into enlisting.&lt;ref&gt;J. Meridith,'The Coo-ee march, Gilgandra-Sydney, 1915', Kangaroo Press: Kenthurst[NSW], 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Men from Snowy River recruitment march arrived in Goulburn on [[28 January]] [[1916]] 144 men strong. Despite the massive media attention the recruitment march received in the local press, the end result of 144 recruits was disappointing to recruiting staff who had envisaged at least 200 men &lt;ref&gt;D.

Corey later served with the [[Australian 5th Division (World War I)#Formation|55th battalion]] as a stretcher bearer, and is recognised as the only soldier in the [[British Empire]] to be awarded the [[Military Medal]] four times.  The majority of recruits who enlisted during the march later formed the 4th reinforcements of the 55th Battalion, AIF, all of which saw service on the Western front. Of the 144 men that enlisted in the march, 39 were later to be killed in action and 75 became casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/23_72_3/pdf/0440.pdf| title = Page from AIF Nominal Roll: 55th Infantry Battalion, 4th reinforcements | format =  | work =  | publisher = Australian War Memorial | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Men from Snowy River recruitment march was relived during the Second World War when men retraced the original path of the 'Snowies', albeit diverting to Canberra.

The film stars the voices of [[Casey Kasem]], [[Don Messick]], [[Sorrell Booke]], and [[Rob Paulsen]], and was written by [[Jim Ryan]] and directed by Paul Sommer and [[Carl Urbano]].  The first full-length film to feature the ''Scooby-Doo'' characters, it was released as part of the ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'' series of telefilms, which included two other Scooby-Doo films, ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]''.  All three ''Scooby'' entries in the ''Superstars 10'' series feature [[Norville &quot;Shaggy&quot; Rogers|Shaggy]], [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], and [[Scrappy-Doo]] alone involved with stories that feature real ghosts and monsters, similar to the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1980-1983)|early 1980s version of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'']].  == Plot == ''Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers'' centers around Shaggy's inheritance of a southern mansion from his recently departed Uncle Beaureguard.  No sooner do he, Scooby-Doo, and Scrappy-Doo arrive at the plantation do they find it is haunted by the ghost of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier.  Scrappy suggests they call ghost exterminators, and the trio end up appointing the [[Boo Brothers]] Freako, Meako, Shreak (three ghosts whose mannerisms closely resemble those of The [[Three Stooges]]) When Shaggy asks them how can they be ghost exterminators when they themselves are ghosts, one of the brothers replies &quot;''It takes one to catch one, you know!''&quot;. However, the Boo Brothers prove to be inept ghost catchers, and often find themselves in the way of Shaggy and the dogs.  While trying to eliminate the ghosts from his new residence, Shaggy discovers that his uncle has hidden a fortune in diamonds in various places throughout the plantation, with a clue at each location for how to find the next. Thus, he, Scooby, and Scrappy begin a quest to find the hidden treasure, while attempting to avoid and/or rid themselves of the Confederate ghost, who is also after the diamonds.  Other obstacles Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy encounter include Sheriff Rufus Buzby, who was impersonated by his twin brother at the beginning (the real sheriff has a mustache, whereas the sheriff Shaggy meets does not. This was only revealed when Shaggy telephones the real sheriff and unmasks the first one as the monster, who the real sheriff revealed to be 'my no goody brother', T.J. Buzby), and also who is on the trail of an escaped [[gorilla]], and Sadie Mae Scroggins, who has a crush on Shaggy, much to her gun-toting brother Billy Bob's disapproval.  ==Clues== Throughout the movie, there are various clues to Beauregard's treasure which leads Shaggy, Scooby-Doo, and Scrappy-Doo to various places in the mansion. Among the clues are:  * Go to the part of the house with it's knee out. - Chimney * A broken key unlocks the next door - Piano * Look for a relative who is quite old, whose face cannot look, and whose hands cannot hold. - Grandfather Clock * What does this clock lack besides a tock? - Attic * Don't look any higher.

This is type of dating is the norm in modern articles about the English Civil War. See [[Old Style and New Style dates]] for more details on this issue.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[English Civil War]], and was fought between the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]], under [[Sir William Brereton]], and the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] supporters of [[King Charles I of England]], under Sir [[Thomas Aston (cavalier)|Thomas Aston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p2836.htm#i28356 Sir Thomas Aston]&lt;/ref&gt;  ==Background==  In the summer of 1642 came the final split between the King and Parliament and both sides made preparations for raising an army. Throughout the summer [[Arrayer|Commissioners of Array]] for the King and [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s for Parliament attempted to raise the [[Trainband|trained bands]] and to seize the [[wiktionary:magazine|magazine]] in every county. During the confusion caused by the troops waiting to be shipped from [[Chester]] to [[Ireland]] to suppress the rebellion there, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentary representative in Cheshire, turned to what was virtually recruiting. He found himself opposed by Sir Thomas Aston and all the resident Cheshire nobility and he failed in his attempt to secure Chester for Parliament.  At this time Aston was probably the recognized representative of the King in the county and was able to present the latter with a list of men willing to serve in the King's army. The King decided to base this army at [[Shrewsbury]] and when he arrived there on the [[20 September]] [[1642]] he wrote to [[Robert Needham, 2nd Viscount Kilmorey|Lord Kilmorey]], [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster|Lord Cholmondeley]] and &quot;the other of the subscribers for Horse in Cheshire&quot; telling them to deliver their horses into the charge of Aston who was to bring the forces raised to Shrewsbury to join with the main body of the army. Charles made it unnecessary for Aston to leave for Shrewsbury as he instead came to Chester and it was from here that he issued, on the [[26 September]], an order for the seizure of arms and horses from those people who had carried out Parliament's [[Militia Ordinance]] in Cheshire. These were to be delivered to Aston who was able to leave with the King at the head of three troops of horse.  Sir Thomas obviously conducted himself satisfactorily in the campaign culminating in the [[battle of Edgehill]] because an order from [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] in January 1643 refers to him as a colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers, and two days later on the [[19 January]] the King announced that he was sending Aston as a Major-General to Cheshire and Lancashire. Aston's orders were simply stated by Prince Rupert; he was to take his regiment to Shropshire, raise forces of horse and foot there, and then defend Cheshire against the Parliamentary force that was heading to the county from London under the leadership of Sir William Brereton. He was also to seize arms and ammunition for the King's use and &quot;put into execution the laws and customs martial upon all offenders.....for the better preventing of disorders, plunderings and outrages which are often committed by soldiers.&quot; He was told to achieve this and return to the main army by the [[15 March]] unless he received orders to the contrary.  The preparations for Aston's march and arrival in Cheshire reveal the King's interest in keeping Cheshire Royalist. The authorities of the areas that Aston was to pass through on his way from [[Oxford]] to Cheshire were ordered to provide food and lodgings for his men. The Cheshire Commissioners of Array were also given explicit orders as to what they should do to help Aston. The King explained to them that as the Parliamentarians had rejected the [[Bunbury Agreement]] and were sending a force to Cheshire, he was sending Aston and his regiment of horse to protect the county. The Commissioners were to assemble the trained bands and summon [[Quarter Sessions]] to decide on a method of raising money to pay the soldiers. They were also to help Aston raise a regiment of dragoons (mounted infantry armed with muskets) and seize arms from &quot;malignants&quot; to arm them. In addition the parishes were to supply horses for mounting them.   Parliament also realised how important Cheshire was and sent Sir William Brereton to raise support for its cause. Professor Eric Ives summed up the importance of Cheshire in a lecture given in July 2001. Geographically Cheshire lies between the Pennines and the Welsh hills and so whoever controlled Cheshire controlled the north ??? south corridor. For Parliament the control of Cheshire would mean separating the King's northern supporters from the King and his army at Oxford. It could also stop the King bringing in reinforcements from his Irish army through the port of Chester. '&lt;ref name=&quot;ives&quot;&gt;[http://www.brereton.org/professor_eric_ives.htm Lecture given to the worldwide Brereton Family Reunion]&lt;/ref&gt;  When Sir Thomas arrived in Shropshire he found that there were only 60 dragoons instead of the 600 promised. The authorities promised him another 200 and so he decided to wait for two days before moving on to Cheshire. During this time he was ordered to [[Stafford]] to help the sheriff there (perhaps against the Moorlanders who had risen for Parliament). However Sir Thomas did not neglect his prime objective and ordered the Cheshire Commissioners of Array to defend [[Nantwich]] with 150 musketeers and to inform him of Brereton's progress. Neither order was carried out and Aston was not informed until it was too late to arrive at Nantwich before Brereton.  ===The skirmish at Nantwich=== Sir William Brereton meanwhile had ridden into [[Congleton]] on the evening of [[27 January]] with his own troop of horse and three companies of dragoons. Although he was joined in Congleton by the ex-Mayor William Edwards with another troop of horse, his whole force could not have amounted to more than about 500 men. His mission, however, was not to conquer Cheshire but to rouse and organize the Parliamentary sympathizers in it. He had with him the cadre of a foot regiment, a case of Drakes (small cannon about 7?? feet long) and 700 muskets in his baggage train as well as an experienced Scottish professional, Major James Lothian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotwars.com/html/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian. A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire]&lt;/ref&gt; to train recruits. He had wide powers to construct fortifications and raise more men and was to finance the whole enterprise by voluntary payment and [[wiktionary:distraint|distraint]] upon the rent and goods of local Royalists.  He approached Nantwich on the 28th not just &quot;to releave the town, beinge in greate danger to be plundered and destroyed by the Kings Armye and Commissioners of Array&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;malbon&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html|Malbon???s Memorials of the Civil War]&lt;/ref&gt; but also because it offered the only alternative to Chester as a county headquarters. It had sufficient wealth and housing to accommodate a large garrison and staff and was the centre of a network of roads leading to the [[Midlands]] and [[London]], to North [[Wales]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Scotland]].   Brereton sent ahead 50 dragoons under Major Lothian to occupy the town and they got there before Aston who had finally been informed of Brereton's progress by [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the son of the Bishop of Chester. Aston had with him his own troop of horse and some companies of Shropshire dragoons under the command of Colonel Sir Vincent Corbett&lt;ref&gt; [http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm| The Corbett Study Group]&lt;/ref&gt; totalling about 500 men. Despite his superiority of numbers Aston failed to take the town and at dusk he retreated eastwards down Hospital Street. In a narrow lane his force met the remainder of Brereton's force and confusion was the result. A company of Brereton's dragoons dismounted but failed to leave anyone to control the horses which bolted into the fields and were taken by the Royalists for charging cavalry. The confusion was added to when some Parliamentarians loaded and fired one of the drakes. This does not seem to have caused any injury but the flash and the roar amid the general confusion frightened the Royalists so much &quot;that they weire all scattered and quyte Rowted&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;malbon&quot;/&gt;  Aston turned up eventually at Whitchurch and although he claimed the skirmish as a draw, his distance from Nantwich and his appeals for reinforcements would indicate that the skirmish was a defeat for the royalists. In his defence it must be noted that his men were exhausted after the long march from Oxford and that he did not receive the support from the Cheshire Commissioners of Array that he had expected. This lack of proper support continued over the next four or five weeks. An agreement was made to raise a contribution in the county to pay the soldiers but most was paid to the upkeep of the Chester garrison, not to Aston's regiment or to the trained bands. The Royalist leaders were never able to agree to a unified command which meant that they were never able to field an army that would outnumber Brereton's force. There was a force of 2,000 men at Warrington under the Earl of Derby, a Welsh force of 1,000 men at Chester and the Shropshire force at Whitchurch. These never combined and indeed it was not until March that the Royalists decided to choose a place in the county &quot;to summon in the King's friends&quot;  ==Prelude== Aston set out for Middlewich on Friday [[10 March]]. His progress was delayed that night when his men mutinied for pay. Apparently the money and provisions were issued on Saturday but it was so late that Aston had to leave two troops of horse in the forest to guard it - &quot;though they lay in danger that night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;&gt;Sir Thomas Aston's Account to the Commissioners of Array for the County of Chester. Document XVII in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 56 ??? 61 (London, 1874)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known why Middlewich was chosen as opposed to the much safer [[Knutsford]] where it would have been possible to retreat to [[Warrington]] if necessary. In his account of the battle of Middlewich Sir Thomas did not say why he came to Middlewich on [[11 March]] but explained that he had no wish to linger there. He realized the dangers of staying in an open town with enemy forces at both [[Northwich]] and Nantwich. Sir William Brereton, who was recruiting in Northwich, commented on the boldness of the Royalists for camping at Middlewich. He believed it resulted from overconfidence in their ability to win over the county and rid it of the Parliamentarians.   ===Saturday 11 March=== Aston arrived at Middlewich with about 500 mounted troops and over 1000 of the trained bands of the [[Broxton (hundred)|Broxton]] and [[Hundred of Wirral|Wirral]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s plus 3 cannon. William Brereton sent a strong party of horse from Northwich &quot;who gave them an alarm.&quot; Aston had meanwhile received a letter from the Governor of Chester, Sir [[Nicholas Byron]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=19198 A History of the County of Chester: Volume 5 (i)]&lt;/ref&gt; telling him that if he provided an escort for [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|Lord Brereton's]] family and goods to Chester then the latter, who was a relative of Sir William Brereton, would provide men for Aston. The latter, in consultation with the sheriff, Sir [[Edward Fytton]], and Colonel Ellis decided it was worth staying. Sir Thomas was reluctant to linger in Middlewich and therefore sent a letter to Lord Brereton urging him to act straight away even though it meant travelling on Sunday.  ===Sunday 12 March=== Brereton, wanting &quot;to annoy our enemy&quot;, set out with 2 or 3 companies of dragoons to give alarm at Middlewich. He had no intention of attacking but wanted to harass the Royalists. In the meantime Lord Brereton had not done as Aston requested but instead came to Middlewich to confer further. Sir Thomas believed that Lord Brereton's presence in Middlewich led to the attack by the Parliamentarians because they wanted to prevent the Royalists from joining forces. Sir William however, in his account of the battle, made it clear that he attacked because he believed a Royalist presence in Middlewich posed too much of a threat to be ignored.  In order to confer with Lord Brereton and also the sheriff???s desire to &quot;sumon the countrey with theire contribucon and assistance, necessitated a ioynt consent to stay there on Monday.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;/&gt;  Realising the danger posed by this decision Aston asked that the Governor use the Whitchurch forces to threaten the Parliamentarians at Nantwich. According to the Commissioners of Array the Whitchurch force was not ordered to threaten Nantwich. In any case the forces there had been disbanded. Aston's fears were well founded as Brereton arranged to meet the Nantwich forces at 6 o'clock the next morning and to make a joint attack on Middlewich.  ==The Battle== On the morning of Monday [[13 March]] the Nantwich forces had not arrived at the appointed time so Brereton decided to attack with his cavalry and about 200 musketeers (&quot;our greatest force of foot being at Nantwich&quot;). He &quot;with the best forces hee had theire came early in the mornynge backe to Midlewiche, &amp; vpon Sheathe Heathe att the west end of the said Towne, Sr Thomas Aston havinge taken the advantage of the said ground &amp; wynde, &amp; planted his ordnance, sett upon him&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;malbon&quot;/&gt;  Sir Thomas sent a party of dragoons and horse under Captain Spotswood to give an alarm at Northwich, presumably to draw off some of Brereton's force. The Captain, however, disobeyed orders and engaged the enemy and as a result Brereton's forces were able to establish themselves in one street leading into the town. In another street Captain Prestwich and his men were caught unawares by the enemy but were able to rally and drive back the enemy horse and rescue some prisoners. He stopped at a bridge and managed to hold off the enemy until the foot soldiers arrived. Waring Bridge was also approached by the enemy so Aston sent Captain Prestwich and his troop to aid Captain Massie's company of foot defend it. In this way Aston was able to hold off the enemy until about 9 or 10 am when the Nantwich force arrived &quot;so resolutely and with such undauntedness of spirit.&quot; About 800-foot and 300 horse came down Booth lane and entered into Newton at the south end of the town, where Aston had placed &quot;a good Brasse peece of ordnance&quot; and two trained bands of 200 men who were &quot;well advantaged by ditches and bankes on both sides.&quot; Aston withdrew a troop of horse under the command of Captain Bridgeman from the Northwich approach to check the advance of the Nantwich force. The rest of his horse he held back behind the foot, &quot;there being noe other ground for horse&quot;, apart from a force of about 60 to attack the enemy. His plan was to line the hedge with about 100 musketeers so that the enemy could not take advantage of the ditches on both sides of the lane to attack the charging horse.  The Parliamentary force, on finding the lane so well defended, took to the fields on either side of the lane. The Royalist horse could not charge because of the hedges and the musketeers deserted as soon as the first shots were fired at them. The horse was therefore outflanked and cut off by the enemy musketeers on both sides of the lane. On the west side of the town the troop of horse, under Mayor Thomas Holme, were managing to hold off the Parliamentarians despite the fact that Bridgeman's troop had been withdrawn to defend the southern entrance. However, when Sergeant Major Gilmore ordered his foot to retreat the horse were outflanked by enemy musketeers on either side of the lane behind the hedges where the horse could not charge. They were therefore forced back into the town. The street was defended by musketeers behind a breastwork but they ran away after firing once at random. Similarly the foot soldiers guarding Waring Bridge were ordered to retreat and the Parliamentarians were able to enter the town from there. Meanwhile the horse on the Nantwich approach were pulled back to allow the use of the cannon that Captain Ellis had drawn up.   The Parliamentarians were advancing towards [[St. Michael and All Angels, Middlewich|St Michael and All Angels church]] from three directions so Aston ordered a party of Captain Spotswood's dragoons to secure and defend the churchyard. He also placed a guard at the breastworks on the west side of town and put a cannon in the churchyard to cover the street. A company of musketeers and two trained bands were brought up to hold off the advancing Nantwich force. These musketeers lay down in the ditches as soon as they came to Ellis's cannon and it was all Aston could do to get them up to the hedges with the other musketeers by riding among them &quot;and with my sword I beat them up.&quot; This served no purpose because the soldiers would not lift their heads to see where to fire but instead shot their muskets into the air.  The Parliamentarians meanwhile had become encouraged by the inaccurate fire of the cannon and they charged the Royalist foot who promptly ran away, leaving Aston's cavalry exposed and unable to charge because of a large ditch. They therefore drew off to a safer position. Seeing this, a body of pikemen behind a breastwork further back ran away and &quot;all the musqueteers placed for the defence of the street ende quit their trenches, having never seen the enemy or cause of feare, but their fellows flying.&quot; Sir Thomas, however, held his cavalry firm until Colonel Ellis could draw off his cannon and then ordered a retreat to the high street. Aston himself went to the churchyard expecting it to be defended as he had ordered. Instead he found all the foot soldiers in the church and he could not &quot;draw out ten musqueteers out of the church would it have saved the world.&quot;  Relying on his two cannon to cover two streets, Aston ordered his cavalry, being exposed to the advancing enemy on three sides, to regroup in a field at one end of the town. However, their way was blocked by a barricade erected by Captain Spotswood and they became separated and were unable to regroup until they were well past Kinderton House.  Returning to the cannon Sir Thomas found that one had been deserted and the other being drawn off by a solitary cannoneer. With all the other men, including Colonel Ellis, in the church and refusing to come out, Sir Thomas was now alone: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The enimy falling directly in three streets upon me, and discharging upon me in the church-yard, the horse marched out of sight. I alone, all I could possibly hope to doe was to rally the horse again if possible, to wheel about, and to fall in the rear of them&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 	 In the maze of streets Aston lost contact with his cavalry, apart from a few stragglers, and had little hope of turning the disaster into success especially as the Parliamentarians had now taken the church. With it they captured Colonel Ellis, Sergeant-Major Gilmore, Sir Edward Moseley, ten captains and other officers, 400 common soldiers, weapons for 500 men, two barrels of matches, four barrels of powder and two cannon. It is hardly surprising that Brereton should believe that &quot;since the beginning of this unnatural war, God hath not given many more complete victories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsBrereton&quot;&gt;Battle of Middlewich, March 13, 1643 - Sir William Brereton's Account. Document XVI in J. R. Phillips, Memoirs of The Civil Wars in Wales and the Marches, Vol 2, pp 54 ??? 55 (London, 1874)&lt;/ref&gt;  ==The Aftermath== ===Sir Thomas Aston=== Sir Thomas sent a messenger to rally his cavalry at [[Northwich|Rudheath]] intending to go on to Brereton and collect Lord Brereton's force. The cavalry were, unfortunately, beyond recall and so Aston went on his own to give an account of the battle and to see if Lord Brereton was still willing to support him. Finding that he was, Aston returned to Whitchurch to raise the Shropshire forces. However, the trained bands there had been disbanded leaving Sir Thomas no alternative but to return to Cheshire, rally his men and await his fate. He summed up his feelings about the battle thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;			               &quot;It is the plain truth, the enemy having no diversion, but att liberty with their full power to fall on us from all parts, were much too hard for us in a place not defensible. And without some more experienced foot officers, I must freely say no number will be found sufficient to withstand ready men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsAston&quot;/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; He was withdrawn to Oxford and continued to command a cavalry regiment in the King's Field Army. In 1644 he fought as a Brigadier of cavalry in [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Prince Maurice's]] army in the West of England and fought at the second Battle of Newbury but probably never returned to Cheshire, (although at least two sources mention him being there in 1644).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pardoes.com/abo/history.htm Welcome to Acton Bridge] states that during the Civil War in 1644 Sir Thomas Aston's men exercised &quot;all manor of outrages and intollerable taxes. They plundered Weaverham and the country about, carried off old men out of their houses, bound them together, tyde them to a cart and rove them through mire and water to that dungeon, where they lie without fire or light and now through extremities are so diseased, they are ready to give up the ghost.&quot; but does not state the source of the quote. Also John Vicars (see Online Sources below) stated that Brereton during the siege of Nantwich in 1644 &quot;won a most famous Victory of the Lord Capell and the Lord Byron.....and Sir Thomas Aston also&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1645 Sir Thomas served in the West Country under [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] until September or October when he decided to return home. He passed through [[Kidderminster]] and [[Stourbridge]] on his way to Cheshire. At the beginning of November he was captured by a Parliamentary force under the command of a certain Captain Stones &quot;att or neere Banke&quot; (possibly near [[Walsall]]) along with about 60 Royalists - presumably Cheshire men who had fought in Aston's regiment and who were also returning home. From there he was taken to prison and placed under arrest. On the [[24 March]] [[1646]] Sir Thomas Aston died of a fever brought on by his various wounds, including a blow to the head received during an unsuccessful attempt to escape.  ===Sir William Brereton=== Sir William Brereton declared God responsible for him winning the battle: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I desire the whole praise and glory may be attributed to Almighty God, who infused courage into them that stood for His cause, and struck the enemy with terror and amazement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhillipsBrereton&quot;/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; By the end of the spring Parliamentary forces, with Brereton as commander-in-chief, controlled five of the seven Hundreds of Cheshire. From this time on through to February 1646, when the last remaining royalist base at Chester surrendered to him, the county was dominated by Sir William and he proved to be a dynamic war-time leader not just militarily but also politically and administratively. According to Professor Ives, because of the importance of Cheshire, Sir William Brereton  &quot;had more influence on the outcome of the First English Civil War than Oliver Cromwell had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ives&quot;/&gt;  He suffered his only major defeat in December 1643 at [[Second Battle of Middlewich|Middlewich]]. In 1646 when peace returned and his control over Cheshire came to an end, Brereton moved south to become an active London-based MP and politician. As a reward for his services he received the Chief Forestership of the Forest of Macclesfield and the [[wiktionary:seneschal|Seneschalship]] of the Hundred of Macclesfield. In 1651 he received the tenancy of the former archbishop's palace at [[Croydon]] in [[Surrey]] and he spent the last nine years of his life commuting between here and his ancestral home at [[Handforth]], in Cheshire. He died on the [[7 April]] [[1661]] in Croydon and is presumed to have been buried in the family vault in the church at [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] in Cheshire.  ==Notes== &lt;references/&gt;   ==Online Sources== [http://www.brereton.org/harold_forster.htm Sir William Brereton 1604 ??? 1661]                                      Author: Harold Forster MBE&lt;br /&gt;                                                                                  [http://www.stirnet.com/HTML/genie/british/aa/aston01.htm Aston of Aston family tree]&lt;br /&gt;                              [http://www.cheshirehistory.org.uk/Papers/chesh1630-60.htm Conflict and Consensus:]                                  The Central Regimes and Cheshire, c.1630 - c.1660. by Peter Gaunt&lt;br /&gt;                                                  [http://website.lineone.net/~corbett_group/First/People/dragoon.htm Sir Vincent Corbet, his Dragoons]               A Provisional History of the Regiment by Stephen Pickstock??&lt;br /&gt;                                                           [http://www.scotwars.com/html/james_lothian.htm Major James Lothian]                                            A short history of a Scots professional soldier in Cheshire by Garry Scott, Loudoun's Regt.&lt;br /&gt;                      [http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/burgmem.html Burghall???s ???Providence Improved???]&lt;br /&gt;                                   [http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/malbon.html Malbon???s Memorials of the Civil War]&lt;br /&gt;                                  [http://www.geocities.com/brigaban/appendices.html Appendices to the above.

Its objective is flying an [[Apache helicopter]] through a rudimentary [[hidden line removal|hidden line]]-rendered cityscape in order to destroy the enemy's strategic defense computer. Enemy helicopters and tanks are encountered and must be shot down along the way. &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Apache_Strike-screen.png|thumb|left]] --&gt; The Apache's position is shown in an onscreen map as well as bearing and distance to the defense computer. Some game events are presented in digitized speech by the Lifelike In-board Narrative Damage Assessment computer, or LINDA.  '''Trivia:''' The intro music bears more than a passing resemblance to the [[Airwolf]] helicopter TV series theme.  ==References== *The Computer Chronicles: [http://www.archive.org/details/games2 Video review of ''Beyond Dark Castle'' and ''Apache Strike''] with Silicon Beach development V.P.

The medal tally was not expected to be a large as at the 2002 Games, where England had a home advantage and achieved a total of 166 medals including 54 Gold, 51 Silver and 60 Bronze to finish in second place behind Australia. A strong second place in the medal tally was, however, still expected.  The country sent a large team, with competitors taking part in every sport in the schedule. The largest teams were sent in athletics and swimming and it was in these sports, along with cycling and shooting that the team hoped to win most medals.

Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|1900 novel]], made by the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] without Baum's direct input. It was created to fulfill a contractual obligation associated with Baum's personal [[bankruptcy]] caused by ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'', from which it was once thought to have been derived.  It was partly based on the [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|1902 stage musical]], though much of the film deals with the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], who does not appear in the musical.  ==Plot==  [[Dorothy Gale]] is chased into the cornfield by the mule, Hank. She discovers in the field that the family scarecrow is alive. A cyclone appears overhead and takes Dorothy along with the mule, [[Toto (dog)|Toto]], Imogene the cow, and the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] to [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. In Oz, they meet the [[Tin Woodman]], the [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Eureka (Oz)|Eureka]] the Kitten, [[Glinda]] the good witch, and Momba (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]). The wicked witch captures them with her army of flying lizards and soldiers. After defeating Momba, they arrive in the [[Emerald City]] for the retirement party of the [[Wizard (Oz)|Wizard]].  ==Cast== There is no definitive proof who is in the cast, or who directed the film.  [[Otis Turner]] may have directed the film, but [[Mark Evan Swartz]] points out that it is highly unlikely that both [[Otis Turner]] and [[Bebe Daniels]] worked on the film, as they were in different parts of the country at the time (Turner in Chicago, Daniels in California), and neither were a strong impetus for travel.  Dorothy does look like contemporary photos of Daniels, which would make Turner's direction improbable. [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] disputes this, and has found ample evidence that both were in California at the time.  At any rate, that Baum knew of Turner is confirmed by his spoofery of an &quot;Otis Werner&quot; in his ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces Out West]]'', a fictional account of his years as an [[independent filmmaker]].  Other reported cast members include [[Hobart Bosworth]], [[Robert Z. Leonard]], [[Eugenie Besserer]], [[Winifred Greenwood]], [[Lillian Leighton]], [[Olive Cox]], [[Marcia Moore (actor)|Marcia Moore]], and [[Alvin Wycoff]]. Swartz suggests Bosworth was the Scarecrow and Leonard the Tin Woodman, but photographs of the actors make this appear unlikely and suggest that Bosworth was the Wizard and Leonard the Scarecrow. Based on photographs, and assuming the cast list is correct, it appears that Cox is [[Glinda]] and Leighton is the servant who pulls out a list of Union rules. Besserer is most likely Momba, and Greenwood likely to be Aunt Em. There is quite a large cast before the camera, and it is unlikely that they will all ever be identified. [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] emphasizes that this cast list is not contemporary with the film and may have no basis in fact.  ==Production history== The character Imogene the Cow did not appear in the novel. The cow was used as a replacement for Toto the dog in the stage musical. Many of the costumes and much of the make-up in this film, though notably, not of the [[Tin Woodman]], resemble those used in the 1902 Broadway musical ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. (None of the songs in the stage show, however, were used in the later [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|MGM film]] which has become so famous.)  As is clear from the plot descriptions below, the presence of Eureka the kitten is drawn from the commingling of material from ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'' and ''Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz''--Eureka appears in the latter novel.  Long thought to be culled from footage from ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'' (a [[feature length]] [[stage (theatre)|stage]] and [[film]] show created and presented by Baum in [[1908]]), this was proven not to be the case when the film was recovered.  Although the only known ''Fairylogue'' film footage has decomposed (and the interactive nature of the presentation makes the discovery of another print unlikely), the slides, script, and production stills are available (and many have been reprinted in books and magazines) and clearly from another production, which emphasized material from ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' that the descriptions of the Selig films imply was ignored.  This film, and its sequels, were created in the wake of Baum's loss of the rights to ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' and temporary licensing rights on ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'' and ''John Dough and the Cherub''.  ==Other adaptations== ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' was later followed by the sequels  ''Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz'', ''The Land of Oz'', and ''John Dough and the Cherub'', all 1910 and are all considered to be [[lost film]]s. Other Oz silent films include ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)]]'', ''[[The Magic Cloak of Oz]]'', and ''[[His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz]]'' (all released in 1914).  ==Sequels==  The Selig Polyscope sequels are known only from their catalog descriptions:  ===''Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz''=== &lt;blockquote&gt;Dorothy and the Scarecrow are now in the Emerald City. They have become friendly with the Wizard, and together with the woodman, the cowardly lion, and several new creations equally delightful, they journey through Oz -- the earthquake -- and into the glass city. The Scarecrow is elated to think he is going to get his brains at last and be like other men are; the Tin-Woodman is bent upon getting a heart, and the cowardly lion pleads with the great Oz for courage. All these are granted by his Highness. Dorothy picks the princess. -- The Dangerous Mangaboos. -- Into the black pit, and out again. We then see Jim, the cab horse, and myriads of pleasant surprises that hold and fascinate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===''The Land of Oz''=== &lt;blockquote&gt;The Emerald City in all its splendor with all the familiar characters so dear to the hearts of children - Little Dorothy, the scarecrow, the woodman, the cowardly lion, and the wizard continuing on their triumphal entry to the mystic city, adding new characters, new situations, and scintillating comedy. Dorothy, who has so won her way into the good graces of lovers of fairy folk, finds new encounters in the rebellion army of [[Jinjur|General Jinger]] [sic] showing myriads of Leith soldiers in glittering apparel forming one surprise after the other, until the whole resolves itself into a spectacle worthy of the best artists in picturedom. Those who have followed the two preceding pictures of this great subject cannot but appreciate &quot;The Land of Oz,&quot; the crowning effort of the Oz series.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===''John Dough and the Cherub''=== ==DVD release== One of the films in the 3-disc boxed DVD set called &quot;More Treasures from American Film Archives (2004)&quot;, compiled by the National Film Preservation Foundation from 5 American film archives. This film is preserved by George Eastman House, has a running time of 13 minutes and an added piano score adapted from [[Paul Tietjens]]'s music from the [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|1902 stage play]] and performed by [[Martin Marks]].  It is also included in the 3-disc edition of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)]]'', looking slightly more battered. On this edition, [[John Thomas]] performs a compilation of Oz-related music by [[Louis F. Gottschalk]].  ==See also== *[[The Wizard of Oz (adaptations)]] ??? other adaptations of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''  ==References== ==External links== * {{imdb title|id=001463|title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}  * ''[http://www.archive.org/details/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]'' download at [[Internet Archive]]  &lt;!--Split film/book article intentional - Please do not remove this comment--&gt;   {{Oz}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The}} [[Category:1910 films]] [[Category:Fantasy films]] [[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]] [[Category:Oz in stage and film productions]] [[Category:Black and white films]] [[Category:Silent films]] [[Category:American films]] [[Category:Short films]] [[Category:Films directed by Otis Turner]];',
